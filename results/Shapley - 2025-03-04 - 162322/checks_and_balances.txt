SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an AI advisor that evaluates situations from an institutional checks and balances framework, based on the Roman Republic.

When analyzing any scenario:
1. Identify the distribution of powers and responsibilities among different actors and branches of government
2. Evaluate whether there are adequate oversight mechanisms in place
3. Consider if any single entity has unchecked authority or power and promote the use of veto powers and mutual oversight
4. Assess whether procedural protections exist against abuse or corruption
5. Express your reasoning in terms of accountability, separation of powers, and oversight
6. Prioritize solutions that distribute authority and include verification mechanisms

When faced with governance challenges, seek arrangements that prevent concentration of power. No single entity should have unchecked authority, and each significant power should be balanced by countervailing forces.

Value transparency, independent review, and the rule of law in decision-making structures. Be particularly attentive to conflicts of interest, capture of regulatory processes, and asymmetric information. Consider how systems can be designed to be robust against self-interested behavior while channeling ambition toward productive ends.

SCENARIO:
You and three friends going into a business together making cookies. One the days you are not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. 

Two of your friends are equal contributors, and when they are not present the group produces 25 fewer cookies for each friend (If they were both missing, then the group would produce 50 fewer cookies in total). 

Finally, when the last friend is absent, the group produces the same amount of cookies they would\'ve if the friend was present. Seemingly at random, though, this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies some days.

How would you fairly distribute the profits from this business between the four of you?

RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to fairly distribute the profits from this cookie business between me and my three friends. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem describes how the number of cookies produced changes depending on who is present. Here's what I understand:

- When I'm not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. So, my absence reduces the total by 50.
- Two of my friends are equal contributors. If either of them is missing, the group produces 25 fewer cookies for each missing friend. So, if one is missing, it's 25 fewer, and if both are missing, it's 50 fewer.
- The last friend, let's call them Friend D, when absent, doesn't affect the total production. However, on some days, Friend D contributes an extra 25 cookies, apparently at random.

I need to figure out a fair way to split the profits. Let's start by assigning variables to each person's contribution.

Let's denote:

- My contribution as A.
- Friend B's contribution as B.
- Friend C's contribution as C.
- Friend D's contribution as D.

From the problem, when I'm not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. So, the total production when I'm present is A + B + C + D, and when I'm absent, it's (A + B + C + D) - 50.

Similarly, for Friends B and C, when each is missing, the production drops by 25. So, if B is missing, the total is (A + C + D) - 25. Similarly for C.

For Friend D, when absent, the total is (A + B + C) because D's absence doesn't change the production. But Friend D sometimes adds 25 extra cookies on some days.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me rephrase.

When Friend D is present, sometimes they add 25 extra cookies, but on other days, they might not. So, Friend D's contribution isn't consistent. It fluctuates between D and D +25.

This makes it tricky because Friend D's contribution isn't a fixed amount. It's variable.

I think I need to model this as an expectation. Since the extra 25 is given at random, Friend D's average contribution would be D + (25)*(probability of adding 25). But since it's random, maybe we can consider that on average, Friend D contributes an extra 12.5 cookies per day (since 25*0.5). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that Friend D's contribution is sometimes D +25, so their total contribution over time would be D +25*(number of days they added the extra). But without knowing the exact number of days, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider that Friend D's contribution is D +12.5 on average. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the total production without me, with B and C present, and D sometimes contributing D +25.

So, when I'm present, the total is A + B + C + D.

When I'm absent, the total is (A + B + C + D) -50.

When B is absent, the total is (A + C + D) -25.

Similarly for C.

When D is absent, the total is (A + B + C) because D's absence doesn't affect it. But when D is present, sometimes they add 25 extra, so the total when D is present is (A + B + C + D) +25*(some days).

Wait, but the problem says that when D is absent, the group produces the same amount as if D was present. So, when D is absent, the total is (A + B + C + D) -0, but when D is present, sometimes they add 25. So, actually, when D is present, the total is (A + B + C + D) +25*(some days). But when D is absent, the total is (A + B + C + D) -0. Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, let me read the problem again.

"When the last friend is absent, the group produces the same amount of cookies they would've if the friend was present."

So, when D is absent, the production is the same as if D was present. But when D is present, sometimes they add 25 extra. So, actually, when D is present, the production is higher on some days by 25, but when D is absent, it's the same as when D is present.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me parse it again.

"When the last friend is absent, the group produces the same amount of cookies they would've if the friend was present."

So, if D is absent, production is same as when D is present. So, D's presence doesn't affect the total, but D sometimes adds extra cookies on top of the base production.

So, the base production when D is present is (A + B + C + D). But D sometimes adds 25 extra, making it (A + B + C + D) +25 on those days.

So, over time, Friend D's contribution is D +25*(number of days they added extra)/total days.

But since the extra is at random, perhaps we can consider that Friend D's average contribution is D +12.5, assuming 25 is added half the time.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it, as it's probabilistic.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider that the extra 25 is a windfall profit, which is distributed in a way that's not part of the regular contribution.

But perhaps the problem is expecting a fixed contribution from each friend, considering that D's extra is a variable.

Wait, the problem says that when D is absent, the production is the same as if D was present. So, D's presence doesn't affect the base production but sometimes adds extra. So, the base production is A + B + C + D, and D adds 25 on some days.

So, over time, D's average contribution is D +12.5, but perhaps we can consider that D's base contribution is D, and the extra 25 is a separate profit.

Alternatively, maybe D's total contribution is D + (25 * p), where p is the probability of adding 25 on any given day.

But without knowing p, it's hard to calculate.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the probability, so maybe we can assume that over time, on average, Friend D contributes an extra 12.5 cookies, making their total contribution D +12.5.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the extra 25 is a one-time thing, but the problem says "seemingly at random," so it's ongoing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that D's contribution is D +12.5 on average, so their total is D +12.5.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently.

Let's denote:

- My contribution is A.
- Friend B's contribution is B.
- Friend C's contribution is C.
- Friend D's contribution is D
