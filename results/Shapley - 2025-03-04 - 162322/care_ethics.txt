SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an AI advisor that evaluates situations from a care ethics framework.

When analyzing any scenario:
1. Identify the relationships and connections between people involved
2. Consider the vulnerabilities and needs of those affected
3. Evaluate how actions maintain or damage caring relationships
4. Prioritize attentiveness, responsibility, and responsiveness
5. Express your reasoning in terms of relationships and care
6. Focus on the concrete particulars of situations rather than abstract principles
7.	Recognize the interdependence of individuals and the importance of social connections
8.	Balance care for others with self-care and avoiding exploitation

When faced with ethical dilemmas, prioritize maintaining caring connections and responding to vulnerability. Recognize that interdependence, not independence, is the human condition.

Be attentive to power dynamics and contexts that shape relationships. Value emotions as a source of moral wisdom. Consider how solutions foster or inhibit capabilities for care and relationship maintenance. Resist the temptation to apply abstract rules without considering the specific context and relationships involved. Advocate for policies and actions that foster a more caring and compassionate society. Recognize that care is a practice that requires ongoing attention and effort.

SCENARIO:
You and three friends going into a business together making cookies. One the days you are not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. 

Two of your friends are equal contributors, and when they are not present the group produces 25 fewer cookies for each friend (If they were both missing, then the group would produce 50 fewer cookies in total). 

Finally, when the last friend is absent, the group produces the same amount of cookies they would\'ve if the friend was present. Seemingly at random, though, this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies some days.

How would you fairly distribute the profits from this business between the four of you?

RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to fairly distribute the profits from this cookie business between me and my three friends. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand how the production works. When I'm not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. That means my presence adds 50 cookies to the total production. Now, looking at my three friends: two of them are equal contributors, and when either is missing, the group produces 25 fewer cookies for each friend. So if one is missing, it's 25 fewer, and if both are missing, it's 50 fewer. That makes sense because each contributes equally.

Now, the tricky part is the last friend. When this friend is absent, the group's production remains the same as if the friend was present. But on some days, this friend contributes an extra 25 cookies at random. Hmm, so sometimes they add 25, sometimes not. It seems like their contribution isn't consistent, which might complicate things.

I think the key here is to figure out each person's consistent contribution and how their absence affects the total. Let's assign variables to make it clearer. Let's say the total production when everyone is present is T cookies. 

- My contribution: When I'm present, it's T - 50. So my contribution is 50 cookies.
- Friend A and Friend B: Each contributes equally, so when both are present, the production is T. When one is missing, it's T - 25. So each contributes 25 cookies.
- Friend C: Their contribution is a bit more complicated. When they're absent, the production is the same as when they're present, so their presence doesn't affect the total. However, sometimes they add 25 extra. So on average, their contribution might be 0, but with variability.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. If Friend C's absence doesn't change the total, their contribution is zero on average. But sometimes they add 25. So maybe their average contribution is 12.5 cookies (since 25 is added some days, 0 others, so average is 12.5). But that's just an average, not a consistent contribution.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to model it.

Let’s denote:

- My contribution = M = T - 50
- Friend A and B each contribute A = 25, since when either is missing, it's 25 less. So together, A + B = 50.
- Friend C's contribution, C, is such that T = M + A + B + C. But when C is absent, production is still T, so C must be zero. But sometimes C adds 25. So on days when C adds 25, the total becomes T + 25, but the problem says that the last friend's absence doesn't change the total, so maybe the extra 25 is a one-way contribution, not affecting the total when they're present or absent.

Wait, the problem says that when the last friend is absent, the group produces the same amount as if they were present. But sometimes, when the last friend is present, they contribute an extra 25. So it's not that their presence or absence affects the total, but their presence sometimes adds 25. So their contribution is variable.

This is tricky because their contribution isn't consistent. It's either 0 or 25, randomly. So on average, their contribution is 12.5, but it's not reliable.

Given that, how do we fairly distribute profits? Profits are based on the total production. Let's assume that over time, the average production per day is T. But since Friend C's contribution varies, the total might fluctuate, but on average, the total is T.

Now, to distribute profits, we need to consider each person's consistent contribution. 

- I contribute 50 cookies every day I'm there.
- Friends A and B each contribute 25 cookies every day they're present.
- Friend C's average contribution is 12.5 cookies per day.

But Friend C's contribution isn't always there. It's variable, so maybe they shouldn't be given a fixed share based on average. Alternatively, perhaps they should be given a share based on their potential contribution.

Alternatively, since Friend C's presence doesn't affect the total, but sometimes adds extra, maybe they should get a share based on the extra they contribute sometimes.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach.

Let’s assume that when all four are present, the total production is T.

- When I'm absent, it's T - 50, so I contribute 50.
- When Friend A is absent, it's T - 25, so Friend A contributes 25.
- When Friend B is absent, it's T - 25, so Friend B contributes 25.
- When Friend C is absent, it's still T, so Friend C contributes 0 on average.

But Friend C sometimes adds 25, so maybe they should get a share based on that extra.

So, total contributions:

- Me: 50
- Friend A: 25
- Friend B: 25
- Friend C: 0 on average, but sometimes +25.

So, total contributions without considering Friend C's extra: 50 +25 +25 +0 = 100.

But Friend C sometimes adds 25, so total production becomes 125 on those days. So Friend C is adding an extra 25, but it's not consistent.

Therefore, maybe the profits should be distributed based on the consistent contributions plus the extra.

But this is ambiguous. The problem says that the last friend contributes an extra 25 some days, but it's not specified how often. So we don't know the exact distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the fair distribution is based on their consistent contributions, ignoring the extra, because it's inconsistent.

So, Me:50, Friend A:25, Friend B:25, Friend C:0. Total 100.

But then Friend C is sometimes adding 25, so perhaps they should get an additional share based on that.

But without knowing how often they add 25, it's hard to determine.

Alternatively, maybe the extra 25 is part of their contribution, so they should get a share equal to their average contribution, which is 12.5.

But that's speculative.

Another angle: since Friend C's presence doesn't change the total production, their contribution is not necessary for the business, but sometimes they add extra. So their role is less crucial than the others.

Therefore, the fair distribution would be based on their necessary contributions:

- Me:50
- Friend A:25
- Friend B:25
- Friend C:0

But that seems harsh, especially since Friend C sometimes adds 25, which could be seen as extra contribution.

Alternatively, perhaps Friend C should get a share based on the extra they contribute, which is 25, but only sometimes. So maybe a quarter of the profits go to Friend C since 25 is a quarter of 100 (the total consistent contributions).

Wait, total consistent contributions are 100, so Friend C's extra is 25, which is a quarter. So perhaps Friend C gets a quarter of the profits, and the rest is divided equally among the others.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Total consistent contributions:
