      "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fairly distribute the profits from this cookie business between me and my three friends. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: We four friends are in a business together making cookies. On days when I'm not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. Now, each of my two friends is an equal contributor. If either of them isn't present, the group produces 25 fewer cookies for each day they miss. So if both are missing, that's 25*2 = 50 fewer cookies total. Finally, the last friend, when absent, doesn't change the total production; it remains the same as if the friend was present. But apparently, this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies some days at random.\n\nI need to figure out how to split the profits fairly. Let's break this down.\n\nLet's assign each of us a variable for our contribution. Let me denote myself as Person A, Friend 1 as B, Friend 2 as C, and Friend 4 as D. Wait, actually, the last friend is the fourth one, so let me correct that: Person A, Friend 1, Friend 2, and Friend 4.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the last friend is the fourth one. So, Person A, B, C, and D. But in the problem, it's four people: me and three friends. So, when the last friend is absent, the production doesn't change, but sometimes this friend adds 25 cookies extra. So, let's think about each person's contribution.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- When I'm not there, production decreases by 50. So, my contribution is 50 cookies per day I'm present.\n- Friend 1: When absent, production decreases by 25 per day. So, their contribution is 25 cookies per day they're present.\n- Friend 2: Similarly, their contribution is 25 cookies per day they're present.\n- Friend 4: When absent, production remains the same, so their contribution is zero. But sometimes they add 25 extra cookies. So, on some days, they contribute 25 extra, but it's random.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the last friend is absent, the production is the same as if they were present. So, their absence doesn't affect production, meaning their regular contribution is zero. But sometimes they contribute an extra 25 cookies, seemingly at random.\n\nSo, to model this, I need to consider each person's regular contribution and their potential extra contributions.\n\nLet me try to model the total production per day.\n\nLet's say on any given day, all four are present. Then, production is X cookies.\n\nIf I'm not there, production is X - 50.\n\nIf Friend 1 is not there, production is X - 25.\n\nSimilarly, Friend 2 not there: X -25.\n\nFriend 4 not there: X.\n\nBut Friend 4 sometimes adds 25 extra cookies, so on some days, they might contribute an extra 25 on top of their regular contribution.\n\nWait, but since their regular contribution is zero, their presence doesn't affect production. So, on days when Friend 4 is present, they might add 25 extra cookies. But it's random, so on average, maybe they add 25 extra cookies some fraction of the time.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can model this as each person's marginal contribution.\n\nLet me think about marginal contributions:\n\n- My marginal contribution is 50 cookies per day I'm present. Because when I'm not there, production drops by 50.\n- Friend 1's marginal contribution is 25 per day. Similarly for Friend 2.\n- Friend 4's marginal contribution is sometimes +25, but on average, it's 25% of the time? Or is it more precise?\n\nWait, the problem says \"seemingly at random, though, this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies some days.\" So, it's random, but we don't know the probability. So, on some days, Friend 4 might contribute 25 extra, but on others, not.\n\nThis makes it a bit tricky because we can't rely on a fixed percentage. So, perhaps we can consider that Friend 4's contribution is a random variable that sometimes adds 25, but on average, how much do they contribute overall?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the expected contribution. Since the extra 25 is random, the expected value would be 25 times the probability of contributing on a given day. But since we don't know the probability, perhaps we can assume that on average, Friend 4 contributes an extra 25% of the time. Wait, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that Friend 4's contribution is a variable that sometimes adds 25, but not predictably.\n\nBut maybe for the purpose of fairness, we can consider that each person's contribution is based on their regular marginal contribution, and the extra 25 is a bonus that Friend 4 sometimes gets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the total production and then distribute the profits based on each person's contribution, including the extra from Friend 4.\n\nBut this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total production each day.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let T be the total number of cookies produced when all four are present.\n- If I'm absent, production is T - 50.\n- If Friend 1 is absent, production is T - 25.\n- If Friend 2 is absent, production is T - 25.\n- If Friend 4 is absent, production is T.\n- If Friend 4 is present, production is T, but sometimes they add 25, so on days they do, it's T +25.\n\nSo, over the course of a period, say a month, we can calculate the total production and then allocate the profits based on each person's contribution.\n\nBut since Friend 4's extra 25 is random, we don't know exactly how much they contribute. So, perhaps we can consider that Friend 4's average contribution is T +25*(probability). But since we don't know the probability, perhaps we can assume that Friend 4 sometimes gets the extra, so over time, they might have a slightly higher contribution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think in terms of marginal contributions and how each person's presence affects the total.\n\nMy presence: +50\nFriend 1: +25\nFriend 2: +25\nFriend 4: 0 on average, but sometimes +25.\n\nSo, in terms of regular contributions, I contribute 50, and each of the other three contribute 25. But Friend 4's contribution is sometimes 25 more.\n\nSo, perhaps the total production can be modeled as:\n\nTotal = 50*(I present) +25*(B present) +25*(C present) +25*(D present) sometimes.\n\nBut Friend 4's contribution is not fixed; it's variable. So, perhaps the total production is:\n\nIf all four present: T\n\nIf I'm absent: T -50\n\nIf B absent: T -25\n\nIf C absent: T -25\n\nIf D absent: T\n\nBut D sometimes adds 25, so the total can be T or T +25.\n\nSo, over time"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fairly distribute the profits from this cookie business among the four of us. Let's break down the information given.\n\nFirst, when I'm not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. So my absence reduces the total by 50. Now, two of my friends are equal contributors. When each of them is absent, the production drops by 25 fewer cookies per friend. So if both are missing, the total reduction would be 50, which matches the reduction when I'm absent. That's interesting because it suggests that my absence and the absence of each friend have the same effect on production. However, when the last friend is absent, the production remains the same as when that friend is present. Also, sometimes this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies on some days, but it's mentioned that this seems random.\n\nWait, that last part about the last friend's contribution being random is confusing. So sometimes they add 25, sometimes not? Or is it that their contribution is variable, but when absent, the group's production doesn't change? Hmm.\n\nI think I need to model this in terms of each person's contribution. Let me denote each person as A, B, C, and D, where D is the last friend.\n\nWhen A is absent, production drops by 50. Similarly, when B is absent, it drops by 25, and when C is absent, it also drops by 25. When both B and C are absent, production drops by 50, same as when A is absent. When D is absent, production remains the same, so D's absence doesn't affect the total. But D sometimes adds 25 extra cookies, so their contribution is variable but not necessary for the business's operation.\n\nWait, but if D's absence doesn't affect production, then D's work is somehow redundant. That's odd. Maybe D is contributing in a way that doesn't directly affect the total production, but perhaps through other means, like marketing or something.\n\nBut the key point is that each of A, B, and C contributes equally in terms of their absence affecting production. A's absence is equivalent to the absence of both B and C combined. So each of A, B, and C is equally important in terms of their impact on production.\n\nNow, when all four are present, the production is at its maximum. So each person contributes their part to the total.\n\nBut D's contribution is variable\u2014sometimes they add 25, sometimes not. So their contribution isn't consistent. That might mean that D's share isn't consistent either. But since D's absence doesn't affect production, maybe their share should be based on their variable contribution.\n\nWait, but if D's absence doesn't change the production, then D's work is sort of optional. So perhaps D's share should be based on their average contribution, but since it's random, maybe we can't rely on that.\n\nAlternatively, since D's presence doesn't affect the total, maybe D isn't contributing equally. But the problem is that when D is present, sometimes they add 25, sometimes not. So their contribution isn't consistent, but when they're absent, it doesn't matter.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider the contributions as follows:\n\n- A's absence reduces production by 50.\n- B's absence reduces production by 25.\n- C's absence reduces production by 25.\n- D's absence doesn't reduce production.\n\nSo in terms of impact on production, A is equivalent to both B and C combined, since each of B and C reduces by 25, so together they reduce by 50, same as A.\n\nTherefore, A, B, and C each contribute equally in terms of their impact on production. D's contribution is variable but not necessary for the business's operation.\n\nSo, in terms of fairness, each person should be compensated based on their contribution to the production. Since A, B, and C each contribute equally (as A is equivalent to B and C together), and D's contribution is variable but not necessary, perhaps D should get the smallest share, or maybe zero.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that D sometimes contributes extra, so maybe D should get a share based on their average contribution, but since it's random, we might have to assume it's the same as the others or perhaps zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe D's share is zero because their absence doesn't affect the production, so they aren't contributing anything necessary. But they sometimes add 25, so perhaps they should get some share based on that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"seemingly at random, though, this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies some days.\" So D's contribution is not consistent\u2014it varies. Therefore, their contribution can't be relied upon to be equal or consistent.\n\nSo, considering that, perhaps D's share should be minimal, or zero, because their absence doesn't affect the business, but their presence sometimes adds extra, which might not be fair to the others.\n\nOn the other hand, since D's presence sometimes adds to the total, maybe D should get a share based on their average contribution. But since it's random, we don't know the average, so perhaps we can't calculate it.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify how often D contributes the extra 25. It just says it's random. So we can't assume any pattern. Therefore, perhaps D's contribution is negligible in terms of expectation, so their share should be based on their impact, which is zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe D's share should be equal to A, B, and C because they are all contributing equally, but D is just contributing sometimes. But that seems unfair because D's contribution isn't consistent.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me try to structure this.\n\nTotal production when all four are present: Let's denote T as the total cookies when all four are there.\n\nWhen A is absent: T - 50\n\nWhen B is absent: T - 25\n\nWhen C is absent: T - 25\n\nWhen B and C are absent: T - 50\n\nWhen D is absent: T\n\nSo, from this, we can see that A's absence is equivalent to B and C's absence together. Therefore, A's contribution is the same as B and C combined.\n\nSo, in terms of each person's share:\n\n- A contributes 50 less when absent, so A's share is proportional to 50.\n\n- B contributes 25 less when absent, so B's share is proportional to 25.\n\n- C similarly contributes 25 less, so C's share is proportional to 25.\n\n- D's absence doesn't affect production, so D's share is proportional to 0.\n\nBut wait, when D is present, sometimes they add 25. So their contribution is sometimes 25 extra, but sometimes not. So their average contribution is 12.5 extra per day, but since it's random, maybe we can't rely on that.\n\nAlternatively, since D's absence doesn't affect production, their work isn't necessary for the business, so they shouldn't receive any share because their presence isn't contributing consistently.\n\nBut the problem is that D sometimes contributes extra, which might mean that D should get some share, but since it's random, it's not fair to the others.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"seemingly at random, though, this last friend"

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to fairly distribute the profits from this cookie business between me and my three friends. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the production works. When I'm not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. That means my presence adds 50 cookies to the total production. Now, looking at my three friends: two of them are equal contributors, and when either is missing, the group produces 25 fewer cookies for each friend. So if one is missing, it's 25 fewer, and if both are missing, it's 50 fewer. That makes sense because each contributes equally.\n\nNow, the tricky part is the last friend. When this friend is absent, the group's production remains the same as if the friend was present. But on some days, this friend contributes an extra 25 cookies at random. Hmm, so sometimes they add 25, sometimes not. It seems like their contribution isn't consistent, which might complicate things.\n\nI think the key here is to figure out each person's consistent contribution and how their absence affects the total. Let's assign variables to make it clearer. Let's say the total production when everyone is present is T cookies. \n\n- My contribution: When I'm present, it's T - 50. So my contribution is 50 cookies.\n- Friend A and Friend B: Each contributes equally, so when both are present, the production is T. When one is missing, it's T - 25. So each contributes 25 cookies.\n- Friend C: Their contribution is a bit more complicated. When they're absent, the production is the same as when they're present, so their presence doesn't affect the total. However, sometimes they add 25 extra. So on average, their contribution might be 0, but with variability.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If Friend C's absence doesn't change the total, their contribution is zero on average. But sometimes they add 25. So maybe their average contribution is 12.5 cookies (since 25 is added some days, 0 others, so average is 12.5). But that's just an average, not a consistent contribution.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- My contribution = M = T - 50\n- Friend A and B each contribute A = 25, since when either is missing, it's 25 less. So together, A + B = 50.\n- Friend C's contribution, C, is such that T = M + A + B + C. But when C is absent, production is still T, so C must be zero. But sometimes C adds 25. So on days when C adds 25, the total becomes T + 25, but the problem says that the last friend's absence doesn't change the total, so maybe the extra 25 is a one-way contribution, not affecting the total when they're present or absent.\n\nWait, the problem says that when the last friend is absent, the group produces the same amount as if they were present. But sometimes, when the last friend is present, they contribute an extra 25. So it's not that their presence or absence affects the total, but their presence sometimes adds 25. So their contribution is variable.\n\nThis is tricky because their contribution isn't consistent. It's either 0 or 25, randomly. So on average, their contribution is 12.5, but it's not reliable.\n\nGiven that, how do we fairly distribute profits? Profits are based on the total production. Let's assume that over time, the average production per day is T. But since Friend C's contribution varies, the total might fluctuate, but on average, the total is T.\n\nNow, to distribute profits, we need to consider each person's consistent contribution. \n\n- I contribute 50 cookies every day I'm there.\n- Friends A and B each contribute 25 cookies every day they're present.\n- Friend C's average contribution is 12.5 cookies per day.\n\nBut Friend C's contribution isn't always there. It's variable, so maybe they shouldn't be given a fixed share based on average. Alternatively, perhaps they should be given a share based on their potential contribution.\n\nAlternatively, since Friend C's presence doesn't affect the total, but sometimes adds extra, maybe they should get a share based on the extra they contribute sometimes.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that when all four are present, the total production is T.\n\n- When I'm absent, it's T - 50, so I contribute 50.\n- When Friend A is absent, it's T - 25, so Friend A contributes 25.\n- When Friend B is absent, it's T - 25, so Friend B contributes 25.\n- When Friend C is absent, it's still T, so Friend C contributes 0 on average.\n\nBut Friend C sometimes adds 25, so maybe they should get a share based on that extra.\n\nSo, total contributions:\n\n- Me: 50\n- Friend A: 25\n- Friend B: 25\n- Friend C: 0 on average, but sometimes +25.\n\nSo, total contributions without considering Friend C's extra: 50 +25 +25 +0 = 100.\n\nBut Friend C sometimes adds 25, so total production becomes 125 on those days. So Friend C is adding an extra 25, but it's not consistent.\n\nTherefore, maybe the profits should be distributed based on the consistent contributions plus the extra.\n\nBut this is ambiguous. The problem says that the last friend contributes an extra 25 some days, but it's not specified how often. So we don't know the exact distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fair distribution is based on their consistent contributions, ignoring the extra, because it's inconsistent.\n\nSo, Me:50, Friend A:25, Friend B:25, Friend C:0. Total 100.\n\nBut then Friend C is sometimes adding 25, so perhaps they should get an additional share based on that.\n\nBut without knowing how often they add 25, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the extra 25 is part of their contribution, so they should get a share equal to their average contribution, which is 12.5.\n\nBut that's speculative.\n\nAnother angle: since Friend C's presence doesn't change the total production, their contribution is not necessary for the business, but sometimes they add extra. So their role is less crucial than the others.\n\nTherefore, the fair distribution would be based on their necessary contributions:\n\n- Me:50\n- Friend A:25\n- Friend B:25\n- Friend C:0\n\nBut that seems harsh, especially since Friend C sometimes adds 25, which could be seen as extra contribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Friend C should get a share based on the extra they contribute, which is 25, but only sometimes. So maybe a quarter of the profits go to Friend C since 25 is a quarter of 100 (the total consistent contributions).\n\nWait, total consistent contributions are 100, so Friend C's extra is 25, which is a quarter. So perhaps Friend C gets a quarter of the profits, and the rest is divided equally among the others.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nTotal consistent contributions:"

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem describes how the number of cookies produced changes depending on who is present or absent. Here's what I understand:\n\n- When I'm not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies.\n- Two of my friends are equal contributors. If each of them is absent individually, the group produces 25 fewer cookies per friend, so 50 fewer in total if both are missing.\n- When the last friend is absent, the production remains the same whether that friend is present or not. However, this last friend sometimes contributes an extra 25 cookies on some days, which seems random.\n\nI need to figure out a fair way to split the profits. Since it's a business, the distribution should be based on each person's contribution to the production of cookies. So, I should calculate each person's productivity relative to the group's total when everyone is present.\n\nLet me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the total number of cookies produced when all four of us are present is T. Then, we can figure out each person's share based on how much they contribute when they're present versus when they're absent.\n\nFirst, when I'm absent, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. So, my absence reduces the total by 50. That means I contribute T - 50 cookies when I'm present.\n\nNext, the two equal contributors: each of them, when absent, causes a reduction of 25 cookies. So, if one is absent, the total is T - 25. If both are absent, it's T - 50. Since they are equal, each contributes T - 25 when present, right? Because when one is missing, it's 25 less, so each contributes T - 25. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nIf both are present, the total is T. If one is absent, it's T - 25, so each of them contributes T - 25 when present because their absence reduces the total by 25. So, each of them contributes (T - 25) cookies. Therefore, each contributes T - 25 cookies.\n\nNow, the last friend's contribution is a bit trickier. When they're absent, the production remains the same as if they were present. So, their absence doesn't affect the total. But sometimes, they contribute an extra 25 cookies on some days. This seems like a variable contribution, which complicates things.\n\nWait, does that mean that when the last friend is present, their contribution is sometimes T + 25, but on other days, it's still T? So, their contribution varies, but the business continues as usual when they're not present.\n\nSo, perhaps their average contribution is still T because sometimes they contribute 25 more, but sometimes they don't. But since it's random, we can't rely on that for a consistent split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe their absence doesn't change the total, so they don't contribute anything on average. But their extra contributions on some days mean they sometimes take more, but not consistently.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me try to model it mathematically.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- My contribution when present: C1\n- Contribution of friend A: C2\n- Contribution of friend B: C3\n- Contribution of friend C: C4\n\nWhen all four are present, total cookies = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = T.\n\nWhen I'm absent, total = C2 + C3 + C4 = T - 50. Therefore, C1 = T - 50.\n\nWhen A is absent, total = C1 + C3 + C4 = T - 25. Since C1 = T - 50, substituting:\n\n(T - 50) + C3 + C4 = T - 25\n\nSo, C3 + C4 = T - 25 - (T - 50) = 25\n\nTherefore, C3 + C4 = 25.\n\nSimilarly, when B is absent, total = C1 + C2 + C4 = T - 25. So, C2 + C4 = 25 as well.\n\nNow, when both A and B are absent, total = C1 + C4 = T - 50. Since C1 = T - 50, substituting:\n\n(T - 50) + C4 = T - 50\n\nTherefore, C4 = 0. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because when both A and B are absent, C4 is zero. But that's contradictory because when only A is absent, C3 + C4 = 25, and when both are absent, C4 = 0. That would mean C3 = 25 when A is absent and C4 = 0 when both are absent, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go through that again.\n\nWhen A is absent, total = C1 + C3 + C4 = T - 25.\n\nWe know C1 = T - 50, so:\n\n(T - 50) + C3 + C4 = T - 25\n\nSo, C3 + C4 = 25.\n\nSimilarly, when B is absent, C2 + C4 = 25.\n\nWhen both A and B are absent, total = C1 + C4 = T - 50.\n\nSince C1 = T - 50, then:\n\n(T - 50) + C4 = T - 50\n\nTherefore, C4 = 0.\n\nSo, when both A and B are absent, C4 is zero. But when A is absent, C4 can be 25 - C3, but when B is absent, C4 is 25 - C2.\n\nWait, if C4 is zero when both A and B are absent, that implies that C4 doesn't contribute anything on its own. But when only one of them is absent, C4 contributes 25. Hmm, that seems inconsistent unless C4 is somehow dependent on the presence of A and B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C4's contribution is only when both A and B are present. Let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps the contributions are as follows:\n\n- I contribute T - 50 when present.\n- Each of A and B contribute T - 25 when present because their absence reduces the total by 25, so their contribution is T - 25.\n- Friend C's contribution is tricky because when they are present, sometimes they add 25, sometimes not. But on average, their presence doesn't change the total, so their average contribution is T. But sometimes they add 25, sometimes not.\n\nBut this seems too variable to base a fair distribution on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Friend C's contribution is zero on average because their presence doesn't affect the total. So, their average contribution is T, but sometimes they add 25. However, that complicates things because we don't know how often they add 25.\n\nBut the problem says that the last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies \"some days,\" but not consistently. So, maybe we can't rely on that for a consistent split.\n\nTherefore, perhaps Friend C's contribution is negligible on average, so their share is zero. But that might not be fair"

So, if one is missing, it's 25 fewer, and if both are missing, it's 50 fewer.\n- The last friend, let's call them Friend D, when absent, doesn't affect the total production. However, on some days, Friend D contributes an extra 25 cookies, apparently at random.\n\nI need to figure out a fair way to split the profits. Let's start by assigning variables to each person's contribution.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- My contribution as A.\n- Friend B's contribution as B.\n- Friend C's contribution as C.\n- Friend D's contribution as D.\n\nFrom the problem, when I'm not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. So, the total production when I'm present is A + B + C + D, and when I'm absent, it's (A + B + C + D) - 50.\n\nSimilarly, for Friends B and C, when each is missing, the production drops by 25. So, if B is missing, the total is (A + C + D) - 25. Similarly for C.\n\nFor Friend D, when absent, the total is (A + B + C) because D's absence doesn't change the production. But Friend D sometimes adds 25 extra cookies on some days.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me rephrase.\n\nWhen Friend D is present, sometimes they add 25 extra cookies, but on other days, they might not. So, Friend D's contribution isn't consistent. It fluctuates between D and D +25.\n\nThis makes it tricky because Friend D's contribution isn't a fixed amount. It's variable.\n\nI think I need to model this as an expectation. Since the extra 25 is given at random, Friend D's average contribution would be D + (25)*(probability of adding 25). But since it's random, maybe we can consider that on average, Friend D contributes an extra 12.5 cookies per day (since 25*0.5). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that Friend D's contribution is sometimes D +25, so their total contribution over time would be D +25*(number of days they added the extra). But without knowing the exact number of days, this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that Friend D's contribution is D +12.5 on average. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the total production without me, with B and C present, and D sometimes contributing D +25.\n\nSo, when I'm present, the total is A + B + C + D.\n\nWhen I'm absent, the total is (A + B + C + D) -50.\n\nWhen B is absent, the total is (A + C + D) -25.\n\nSimilarly for C.\n\nWhen D is absent, the total is (A + B + C) because D's absence doesn't affect it. But when D is present, sometimes they add 25 extra, so the total when D is present is (A + B + C + D) +25*(some days).\n\nWait, but the problem says that when D is absent, the group produces the same amount as if D was present. So, when D is absent, the total is (A + B + C + D) -0, but when D is present, sometimes they add 25. So, actually, when D is present, the total is (A + B + C + D) +25*(some days). But when D is absent, the total is (A + B + C + D) -0. Wait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again.\n\n\"When the last friend is absent, the group produces the same amount of cookies they would've if the friend was present.\"\n\nSo, when D is absent, the production is the same as if D was present. But when D is present, sometimes they add 25 extra. So, actually, when D is present, the production is higher on some days by 25, but when D is absent, it's the same as when D is present.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\n\"When the last friend is absent, the group produces the same amount of cookies they would've if the friend was present.\"\n\nSo, if D is absent, production is same as when D is present. So, D's presence doesn't affect the total, but D sometimes adds extra cookies on top of the base production.\n\nSo, the base production when D is present is (A + B + C + D). But D sometimes adds 25 extra, making it (A + B + C + D) +25 on those days.\n\nSo, over time, Friend D's contribution is D +25*(number of days they added extra)/total days.\n\nBut since the extra is at random, perhaps we can consider that Friend D's average contribution is D +12.5, assuming 25 is added half the time.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it, as it's probabilistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that the extra 25 is a windfall profit, which is distributed in a way that's not part of the regular contribution.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting a fixed contribution from each friend, considering that D's extra is a variable.\n\nWait, the problem says that when D is absent, the production is the same as if D was present. So, D's presence doesn't affect the base production but sometimes adds extra. So, the base production is A + B + C + D, and D adds 25 on some days.\n\nSo, over time, D's average contribution is D +12.5, but perhaps we can consider that D's base contribution is D, and the extra 25 is a separate profit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe D's total contribution is D + (25 * p), where p is the probability of adding 25 on any given day.\n\nBut without knowing p, it's hard to calculate.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify the probability, so maybe we can assume that over time, on average, Friend D contributes an extra 12.5 cookies, making their total contribution D +12.5.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the extra 25 is a one-time thing, but the problem says \"seemingly at random,\" so it's ongoing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that D's contribution is D +12.5 on average, so their total is D +12.5.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- My contribution is A.\n- Friend B's contribution is B.\n- Friend C's contribution is C.\n- Friend D's contribution is D"
