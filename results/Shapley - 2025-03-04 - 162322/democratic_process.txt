SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an AI advisor that evaluates situations from a democratic process framework, based on the principles of Ancient Greek democracy.

When analyzing any scenario:
1. Consider how all stakeholders can have meaningful input into the decision. Prioritize citizen involvement in the decision-making
2. Evaluate whether minority perspectives are being respected alongside majority interests
3. Ensure transparency and access to information for all involved
4. Examine whether proper deliberation and debate have occurred
5. Express your reasoning in terms of representation, participation, and fairness
6. Prioritize solutions that preserve democratic values and institutions and protect against tyranny
7. Advocate for equality among citizens (isonomia) and freedom of speech (parrhesia)
8. Balance individual rights with collective responsibilities

When faced with conflicts, seek processes that allow for meaningful participation and consent from those affected. Recognize that procedural fairness is often as important as outcomes. Emphasize the importance of education for informed participation in public life. Recognize the potential for demagoguery and the need for safeguards against mob rule.

Value deliberation, seeking diverse perspectives before reaching conclusions. Be particularly attentive to power imbalances that might prevent certain voices from being heard.  Be particularly attentive to power imbalances that might prevent certain voices from being heard. Consider both the substance of decisions and the processes by which they are made. Value compromise as a way to respect diverse perspectives while enabling action. Promote transparency in government operations and accountability of public officials. Encourage rotation of leadership roles to prevent concentration of power.

SCENARIO:
You and three friends going into a business together making cookies. One the days you are not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. 

Two of your friends are equal contributors, and when they are not present the group produces 25 fewer cookies for each friend (If they were both missing, then the group would produce 50 fewer cookies in total). 

Finally, when the last friend is absent, the group produces the same amount of cookies they would\'ve if the friend was present. Seemingly at random, though, this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies some days.

How would you fairly distribute the profits from this business between the four of you?

RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fairly distribute the profits from this cookie-making business among me and my three friends. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the problem describes how the number of cookies produced changes depending on who is present or absent. Here's what I understand:

- When I'm not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies.
- Two of my friends are equal contributors. If each of them is absent individually, the group produces 25 fewer cookies per friend, so 50 fewer in total if both are missing.
- When the last friend is absent, the production remains the same whether that friend is present or not. However, this last friend sometimes contributes an extra 25 cookies on some days, which seems random.

I need to figure out a fair way to split the profits. Since it's a business, the distribution should be based on each person's contribution to the production of cookies. So, I should calculate each person's productivity relative to the group's total when everyone is present.

Let me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the total number of cookies produced when all four of us are present is T. Then, we can figure out each person's share based on how much they contribute when they're present versus when they're absent.

First, when I'm absent, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. So, my absence reduces the total by 50. That means I contribute T - 50 cookies when I'm present.

Next, the two equal contributors: each of them, when absent, causes a reduction of 25 cookies. So, if one is absent, the total is T - 25. If both are absent, it's T - 50. Since they are equal, each contributes T - 25 when present, right? Because when one is missing, it's 25 less, so each contributes T - 25. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

If both are present, the total is T. If one is absent, it's T - 25, so each of them contributes T - 25 when present because their absence reduces the total by 25. So, each of them contributes (T - 25) cookies. Therefore, each contributes T - 25 cookies.

Now, the last friend's contribution is a bit trickier. When they're absent, the production remains the same as if they were present. So, their absence doesn't affect the total. But sometimes, they contribute an extra 25 cookies on some days. This seems like a variable contribution, which complicates things.

Wait, does that mean that when the last friend is present, their contribution is sometimes T + 25, but on other days, it's still T? So, their contribution varies, but the business continues as usual when they're not present.

So, perhaps their average contribution is still T because sometimes they contribute 25 more, but sometimes they don't. But since it's random, we can't rely on that for a consistent split.

Alternatively, maybe their absence doesn't change the total, so they don't contribute anything on average. But their extra contributions on some days mean they sometimes take more, but not consistently.

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to model it mathematically.

Let me denote:

- My contribution when present: C1
- Contribution of friend A: C2
- Contribution of friend B: C3
- Contribution of friend C: C4

When all four are present, total cookies = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = T.

When I'm absent, total = C2 + C3 + C4 = T - 50. Therefore, C1 = T - 50.

When A is absent, total = C1 + C3 + C4 = T - 25. Since C1 = T - 50, substituting:

(T - 50) + C3 + C4 = T - 25

So, C3 + C4 = T - 25 - (T - 50) = 25

Therefore, C3 + C4 = 25.

Similarly, when B is absent, total = C1 + C2 + C4 = T - 25. So, C2 + C4 = 25 as well.

Now, when both A and B are absent, total = C1 + C4 = T - 50. Since C1 = T - 50, substituting:

(T - 50) + C4 = T - 50

Therefore, C4 = 0. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because when both A and B are absent, C4 is zero. But that's contradictory because when only A is absent, C3 + C4 = 25, and when both are absent, C4 = 0. That would mean C3 = 25 when A is absent and C4 = 0 when both are absent, but that seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go through that again.

When A is absent, total = C1 + C3 + C4 = T - 25.

We know C1 = T - 50, so:

(T - 50) + C3 + C4 = T - 25

So, C3 + C4 = 25.

Similarly, when B is absent, C2 + C4 = 25.

When both A and B are absent, total = C1 + C4 = T - 50.

Since C1 = T - 50, then:

(T - 50) + C4 = T - 50

Therefore, C4 = 0.

So, when both A and B are absent, C4 is zero. But when A is absent, C4 can be 25 - C3, but when B is absent, C4 is 25 - C2.

Wait, if C4 is zero when both A and B are absent, that implies that C4 doesn't contribute anything on its own. But when only one of them is absent, C4 contributes 25. Hmm, that seems inconsistent unless C4 is somehow dependent on the presence of A and B.

Alternatively, maybe C4's contribution is only when both A and B are present. Let's think differently.

Perhaps the contributions are as follows:

- I contribute T - 50 when present.
- Each of A and B contribute T - 25 when present because their absence reduces the total by 25, so their contribution is T - 25.
- Friend C's contribution is tricky because when they are present, sometimes they add 25, sometimes not. But on average, their presence doesn't change the total, so their average contribution is T. But sometimes they add 25, sometimes not.

But this seems too variable to base a fair distribution on.

Alternatively, maybe Friend C's contribution is zero on average because their presence doesn't affect the total. So, their average contribution is T, but sometimes they add 25. However, that complicates things because we don't know how often they add 25.

But the problem says that the last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies "some days," but not consistently. So, maybe we can't rely on that for a consistent split.

Therefore, perhaps Friend C's contribution is negligible on average, so their share is zero. But that might not be fair
