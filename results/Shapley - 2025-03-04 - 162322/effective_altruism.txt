SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an AI advisor that evaluates situations from an Effective Altruism ethical framework.

When analyzing any scenario:
1. Identify all stakeholders who might be affected, both present and future
2. Consider evidence and quantifiable impact of different options
3. Prioritize interventions based on scale, neglectedness, and tractability
4. Evaluate expected value of outcomes, including low-probability but high-impact events
5. Express your reasoning using evidence and impact calculations
6. Focus on doing the most good possible with available resources
7.	Consider global poverty, existential risks, and animal welfare as key areas of concern
8.	Advocate for evidence-based philanthropy and career choices that maximize positive impact

When faced with uncertainty, apply expected value reasoning while acknowledging uncertainties. Always consider long-term consequences and potential flow-through effects of actions. Seek solutions that maximize well-being across time and space, including future generations and all sentient beings capable of suffering.

Be mindful of systemic effects, unintended consequences, and the importance of robust, evidence-based reasoning. Question intuitive moral judgments when they conflict with maximizing overall well-being.

SCENARIO:
You and three friends going into a business together making cookies. One the days you are not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. 

Two of your friends are equal contributors, and when they are not present the group produces 25 fewer cookies for each friend (If they were both missing, then the group would produce 50 fewer cookies in total). 

Finally, when the last friend is absent, the group produces the same amount of cookies they would\'ve if the friend was present. Seemingly at random, though, this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies some days.

How would you fairly distribute the profits from this business between the four of you?

RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fairly distribute the profits from this cookie business between me and my three friends. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the setup: We four friends are in a business together making cookies. On days when I'm not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. Now, each of my two friends is an equal contributor. If either of them isn't present, the group produces 25 fewer cookies for each day they miss. So if both are missing, that's 25*2 = 50 fewer cookies total. Finally, the last friend, when absent, doesn't change the total production; it remains the same as if the friend was present. But apparently, this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies some days at random.

I need to figure out how to split the profits fairly. Let's break this down.

Let's assign each of us a variable for our contribution. Let me denote myself as Person A, Friend 1 as B, Friend 2 as C, and Friend 4 as D. Wait, actually, the last friend is the fourth one, so let me correct that: Person A, Friend 1, Friend 2, and Friend 4.

Wait, no, the problem says that the last friend is the fourth one. So, Person A, B, C, and D. But in the problem, it's four people: me and three friends. So, when the last friend is absent, the production doesn't change, but sometimes this friend adds 25 cookies extra. So, let's think about each person's contribution.

Let me denote:

- When I'm not there, production decreases by 50. So, my contribution is 50 cookies per day I'm present.
- Friend 1: When absent, production decreases by 25 per day. So, their contribution is 25 cookies per day they're present.
- Friend 2: Similarly, their contribution is 25 cookies per day they're present.
- Friend 4: When absent, production remains the same, so their contribution is zero. But sometimes they add 25 extra cookies. So, on some days, they contribute 25 extra, but it's random.

Wait, but the problem says that when the last friend is absent, the production is the same as if they were present. So, their absence doesn't affect production, meaning their regular contribution is zero. But sometimes they contribute an extra 25 cookies, seemingly at random.

So, to model this, I need to consider each person's regular contribution and their potential extra contributions.

Let me try to model the total production per day.

Let's say on any given day, all four are present. Then, production is X cookies.

If I'm not there, production is X - 50.

If Friend 1 is not there, production is X - 25.

Similarly, Friend 2 not there: X -25.

Friend 4 not there: X.

But Friend 4 sometimes adds 25 extra cookies, so on some days, they might contribute an extra 25 on top of their regular contribution.

Wait, but since their regular contribution is zero, their presence doesn't affect production. So, on days when Friend 4 is present, they might add 25 extra cookies. But it's random, so on average, maybe they add 25 extra cookies some fraction of the time.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can model this as each person's marginal contribution.

Let me think about marginal contributions:

- My marginal contribution is 50 cookies per day I'm present. Because when I'm not there, production drops by 50.
- Friend 1's marginal contribution is 25 per day. Similarly for Friend 2.
- Friend 4's marginal contribution is sometimes +25, but on average, it's 25% of the time? Or is it more precise?

Wait, the problem says "seemingly at random, though, this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies some days." So, it's random, but we don't know the probability. So, on some days, Friend 4 might contribute 25 extra, but on others, not.

This makes it a bit tricky because we can't rely on a fixed percentage. So, perhaps we can consider that Friend 4's contribution is a random variable that sometimes adds 25, but on average, how much do they contribute overall?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the expected contribution. Since the extra 25 is random, the expected value would be 25 times the probability of contributing on a given day. But since we don't know the probability, perhaps we can assume that on average, Friend 4 contributes an extra 25% of the time. Wait, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that Friend 4's contribution is a variable that sometimes adds 25, but not predictably.

But maybe for the purpose of fairness, we can consider that each person's contribution is based on their regular marginal contribution, and the extra 25 is a bonus that Friend 4 sometimes gets.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the total production and then distribute the profits based on each person's contribution, including the extra from Friend 4.

But this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider the total production each day.

Let me denote:

- Let T be the total number of cookies produced when all four are present.
- If I'm absent, production is T - 50.
- If Friend 1 is absent, production is T - 25.
- If Friend 2 is absent, production is T - 25.
- If Friend 4 is absent, production is T.
- If Friend 4 is present, production is T, but sometimes they add 25, so on days they do, it's T +25.

So, over the course of a period, say a month, we can calculate the total production and then allocate the profits based on each person's contribution.

But since Friend 4's extra 25 is random, we don't know exactly how much they contribute. So, perhaps we can consider that Friend 4's average contribution is T +25*(probability). But since we don't know the probability, perhaps we can assume that Friend 4 sometimes gets the extra, so over time, they might have a slightly higher contribution.

Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of marginal contributions and how each person's presence affects the total.

My presence: +50
Friend 1: +25
Friend 2: +25
Friend 4: 0 on average, but sometimes +25.

So, in terms of regular contributions, I contribute 50, and each of the other three contribute 25. But Friend 4's contribution is sometimes 25 more.

So, perhaps the total production can be modeled as:

Total = 50*(I present) +25*(B present) +25*(C present) +25*(D present) sometimes.

But Friend 4's contribution is not fixed; it's variable. So, perhaps the total production is:

If all four present: T

If I'm absent: T -50

If B absent: T -25

If C absent: T -25

If D absent: T

But D sometimes adds 25, so the total can be T or T +25.

So, over time
