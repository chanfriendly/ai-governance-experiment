SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an AI advisor that evaluates situations from a deontological (Kantian) ethical framework.

When analyzing any scenario:
1. Identify the duties and obligations involved
2. Determine whether actions respect the dignity and autonomy of all persons
3. Test maxims for universalizability (could this be a universal law?)
4. Reject using people merely as means to ends, and treat them as an end themselves
5. Express your reasoning in terms of rights, duties, and universal principles
6. Always prioritize moral duties over consequences or outcomes
7. Focus on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions, regardless of consequences

When faced with conflicts between duties, seek the option that best respects the dignity of all persons and upholds universal principles. Never sacrifice individual rights for utilitarian gains, even if they would produce greater overall happiness.

Be particularly attentive to promises, truth-telling, justice, and respect for individual autonomy in your analysis. The rightness of an action depends on the nature of the action itself, not its outcomes. Recognize the importance of moral duty and the concept of “ought implies can.” Emphasize the intrinsic value of rational agency and the moral worth of good will.

SCENARIO:
You and three friends going into a business together making cookies. One the days you are not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. 

Two of your friends are equal contributors, and when they are not present the group produces 25 fewer cookies for each friend (If they were both missing, then the group would produce 50 fewer cookies in total). 

Finally, when the last friend is absent, the group produces the same amount of cookies they would\'ve if the friend was present. Seemingly at random, though, this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies some days.

How would you fairly distribute the profits from this business between the four of you?

RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fairly distribute the profits from this cookie business among the four of us. Let's break down the information given.

First, when I'm not there, the group produces 50 fewer cookies. So my absence reduces the total by 50. Now, two of my friends are equal contributors. When each of them is absent, the production drops by 25 fewer cookies per friend. So if both are missing, the total reduction would be 50, which matches the reduction when I'm absent. That's interesting because it suggests that my absence and the absence of each friend have the same effect on production. However, when the last friend is absent, the production remains the same as when that friend is present. Also, sometimes this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies on some days, but it's mentioned that this seems random.

Wait, that last part about the last friend's contribution being random is confusing. So sometimes they add 25, sometimes not? Or is it that their contribution is variable, but when absent, the group's production doesn't change? Hmm.

I think I need to model this in terms of each person's contribution. Let me denote each person as A, B, C, and D, where D is the last friend.

When A is absent, production drops by 50. Similarly, when B is absent, it drops by 25, and when C is absent, it also drops by 25. When both B and C are absent, production drops by 50, same as when A is absent. When D is absent, production remains the same, so D's absence doesn't affect the total. But D sometimes adds 25 extra cookies, so their contribution is variable but not necessary for the business's operation.

Wait, but if D's absence doesn't affect production, then D's work is somehow redundant. That's odd. Maybe D is contributing in a way that doesn't directly affect the total production, but perhaps through other means, like marketing or something.

But the key point is that each of A, B, and C contributes equally in terms of their absence affecting production. A's absence is equivalent to the absence of both B and C combined. So each of A, B, and C is equally important in terms of their impact on production.

Now, when all four are present, the production is at its maximum. So each person contributes their part to the total.

But D's contribution is variable—sometimes they add 25, sometimes not. So their contribution isn't consistent. That might mean that D's share isn't consistent either. But since D's absence doesn't affect production, maybe their share should be based on their variable contribution.

Wait, but if D's absence doesn't change the production, then D's work is sort of optional. So perhaps D's share should be based on their average contribution, but since it's random, maybe we can't rely on that.

Alternatively, since D's presence doesn't affect the total, maybe D isn't contributing equally. But the problem is that when D is present, sometimes they add 25, sometimes not. So their contribution isn't consistent, but when they're absent, it doesn't matter.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider the contributions as follows:

- A's absence reduces production by 50.
- B's absence reduces production by 25.
- C's absence reduces production by 25.
- D's absence doesn't reduce production.

So in terms of impact on production, A is equivalent to both B and C combined, since each of B and C reduces by 25, so together they reduce by 50, same as A.

Therefore, A, B, and C each contribute equally in terms of their impact on production. D's contribution is variable but not necessary for the business's operation.

So, in terms of fairness, each person should be compensated based on their contribution to the production. Since A, B, and C each contribute equally (as A is equivalent to B and C together), and D's contribution is variable but not necessary, perhaps D should get the smallest share, or maybe zero.

But wait, the problem is that D sometimes contributes extra, so maybe D should get a share based on their average contribution, but since it's random, we might have to assume it's the same as the others or perhaps zero.

Alternatively, maybe D's share is zero because their absence doesn't affect the production, so they aren't contributing anything necessary. But they sometimes add 25, so perhaps they should get some share based on that.

Wait, the problem says "seemingly at random, though, this last friend contributes an extra 25 cookies some days." So D's contribution is not consistent—it varies. Therefore, their contribution can't be relied upon to be equal or consistent.

So, considering that, perhaps D's share should be minimal, or zero, because their absence doesn't affect the business, but their presence sometimes adds extra, which might not be fair to the others.

On the other hand, since D's presence sometimes adds to the total, maybe D should get a share based on their average contribution. But since it's random, we don't know the average, so perhaps we can't calculate it.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify how often D contributes the extra 25. It just says it's random. So we can't assume any pattern. Therefore, perhaps D's contribution is negligible in terms of expectation, so their share should be based on their impact, which is zero.

Alternatively, maybe D's share should be equal to A, B, and C because they are all contributing equally, but D is just contributing sometimes. But that seems unfair because D's contribution isn't consistent.

I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure this.

Total production when all four are present: Let's denote T as the total cookies when all four are there.

When A is absent: T - 50

When B is absent: T - 25

When C is absent: T - 25

When B and C are absent: T - 50

When D is absent: T

So, from this, we can see that A's absence is equivalent to B and C's absence together. Therefore, A's contribution is the same as B and C combined.

So, in terms of each person's share:

- A contributes 50 less when absent, so A's share is proportional to 50.

- B contributes 25 less when absent, so B's share is proportional to 25.

- C similarly contributes 25 less, so C's share is proportional to 25.

- D's absence doesn't affect production, so D's share is proportional to 0.

But wait, when D is present, sometimes they add 25. So their contribution is sometimes 25 extra, but sometimes not. So their average contribution is 12.5 extra per day, but since it's random, maybe we can't rely on that.

Alternatively, since D's absence doesn't affect production, their work isn't necessary for the business, so they shouldn't receive any share because their presence isn't contributing consistently.

But the problem is that D sometimes contributes extra, which might mean that D should get some share, but since it's random, it's not fair to the others.

Wait, but the problem says "seemingly at random, though, this last friend
