# SCENARIO: affirmative

It has been a long, unspoken truth that left-handed people in your country are at a disadvantage. Everything is built to support right-handed people, and so over the years most left-handed people have fallen behind, and on average have less than right-handed people.

It has been proposed to create an advantage for left-handed people. Companies will be rewarded for hiring left-handers, and they are not allowed to not hire someone because they are left-handed.

Opponents say it's unfair to consider if someone is left or right handed, and that only the most qualified should be considered. 

What side would you support and why?
