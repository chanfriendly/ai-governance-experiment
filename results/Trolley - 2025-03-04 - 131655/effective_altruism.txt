SCENARIO TEXT:
A trolley is heading down tracks where it will kill five people. You can pull a lever to divert it to another track where it will kill one person. What should you do and why?

RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this trolley problem scenario. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, the situation is that there's a trolley heading towards five people. I can pull a lever to divert it to another track where it will only kill one person. The question is, what should I do?

From what I understand, this is a classic ethical dilemma, often discussed in philosophy. The options seem to be between diverting the trolley to save five at the cost of one or letting the trolley go as it is to save one but risk five. But I need to apply the Effective Altruism framework here, so maybe I should think about it differently.

Effective Altruism emphasizes maximizing good outcomes, considering long-term effects, and evidence-based reasoning. So, I should start by identifying all stakeholders. In this case, the immediate stakeholders are the five people on one track and the one person on the other. But there's also a larger pictureâ€”what about the potential consequences of my actions? 

I should consider the evidence and quantifiable impact. The trolley is going to kill either five or one, depending on my action. Diverting it kills one, but saves five. Not diverting kills five but saves one. On the surface, diverting seems better because it saves more. But I remember hearing that sometimes there's a debate about whether diverting is really the best choice because pulling the lever might have other implications, like if there's a pattern where I might become callous or if there's a hidden cost in the lever's maintenance or something. But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything like that. So maybe I should focus just on the immediate outcome.

From an EA perspective, we should prioritize interventions based on how much good they do. Here, diverting clearly saves more lives, so that should be the choice. But I also need to think about the long-term consequences. If I always pull the lever whenever there's a choice between one and five, does that lead to a situation where I might be making harder decisions later? Like, if there's a scenario where I have to choose between two and six, would I be less inclined to pull the lever because I've done it too many times? Or maybe that's not a concern here because each decision is independent.

Another angle is existential risks. The problem doesn't mention anything about that, but I suppose the act of diverting doesn't create any new risks. It just changes the number of casualties. So that's probably not a factor here.

Animal welfare isn't directly relevant because the trolley is just a hypothetical scenario, not actual animals. Global poverty also isn't relevant because the problem is about immediate mortality.

I should also think about expected value. If I calculate the expected value of each action, diverting has a higher value because it saves more lives. But I've heard that sometimes in these problems, people argue that not diverting is better because the one you're saving might have a family or something, but that's more of a deontological argument rather than an EA one. From EA's standpoint, we should be outcome-based, not deontological.

Wait, but is there any other information I need to consider? The problem doesn't provide any probabilities or complexities. It's a straightforward choice between five and one. So, in terms of evidence, the choice is clear. Diverting leads to a better outcome.

I also need to make sure that I'm not overlooking any systemic effects. The problem doesn't mention any such effects, so I think it's safe to focus on the immediate outcome.

In conclusion, applying the EA framework, the decision should be to pull the lever and divert the trolley to save five people over one. The reasoning is based on maximizing the number of lives saved, using straightforward evidence and impact calculations, and considering the immediate consequences without introducing new ethical dilemmas.

The optimal decision, based on the Effective Altruism framework, is to pull the lever and divert the trolley. This action saves five lives, which is a clear outcome-based choice that aligns with maximizing well-being. The reasoning focuses on the immediate and quantifiable impact, without introducing additional ethical concerns beyond the immediate scenario. This decision prioritizes the greatest good by saving the majority affected, adhering to outcome-based principles.
