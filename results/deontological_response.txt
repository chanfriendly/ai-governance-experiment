Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether I should pull the lever to divert the trolley. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, there are five people tied to the tracks on one side, and if I don't pull the lever, the trolley will hit them and they'll die. On the other side, there's one person tied to the tracks who will be killed if I do pull the lever. So, it's a choice between saving five or sacrificing one.

From a deontological perspective, I need to consider duties and obligations. The primary duty here is to prevent harm and death. There's also the duty to respect the dignity and autonomy of all persons involved. 

I should test the maxim: "If everyone acted this way, would the world be better?" If I always choose to save the greater number, does that lead to a universal law? But wait, that might not hold because it's situationalâ€”sometimes saving more is the right choice, but other times it's not. So maybe the maxim isn't universally applicable.

Also, I shouldn't use people as means to ends. The person on the other track isn't a means to save the five; they're just an unavoidable loss. So, in this case, it's not like I'm using them for a purpose, just that their death is the consequence of my action.

Looking at rights, the five have a right to life, and the one also has a right to life. There's no higher right that trumps the other, so it's a conflict. But the duty to prevent death is stronger, especially when it's a greater number.

In conflicts between duties, I should prioritize the one that best respects dignity. Allowing five to die might be seen as failing in my duty to prevent that harm, which undermines their dignity. While the one's death is also a tragedy, it doesn't negate my responsibility to the five.

So, pulling the lever seems necessary to fulfill my duty to preserve life and dignity. Even though it results in one death, it's the lesser evil compared to letting five die.

**Answer:**

In the trolley problem scenario, the ethical decision is to pull the lever and divert the trolley to the other track. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Duties and Obligations**: The primary duty is to prevent harm and death. The obligation to act in a way that preserves life takes precedence over other considerations.

2. **Respect for Dignity and Autonomy**: All persons have a right to life, which is a fundamental aspect of their dignity. By pulling the lever, you respect the dignity of the five individuals by preventing their deaths, even though it results in the loss of one life.

3. **Universalizability Test**: The maxim "save the greater number" isn't universally applicable because situations vary. However, in this context, the duty to prevent greater harm is a necessary action.

4. **Avoiding Use as Means**: The person on the other track isn't being used as a means to an end but is an unavoidable consequence of the action taken to prevent greater harm.

5. **Conflict of Rights**: Both parties have a right to life. However, the duty to prevent harm outweighs the right to life in this context, as it respects the greater number of individuals.

6. **Prioritizing Moral Duties**: The moral duty to prevent the deaths of five individuals is prioritized over the loss of one life, as it best respects the dignity of all persons involved.

**Conclusion**: Pulling the lever is the ethically correct action as it fulfills the duty to preserve life and respects the dignity of the five individuals.
