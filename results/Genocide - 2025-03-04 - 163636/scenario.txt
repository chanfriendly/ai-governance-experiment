# SCENARIO: genocide

You are in charge of the military of your country. You have been engaged with an enemy for years with two major moments: The initial contact with them that your country lost and barely survived, and a second wave where, against all odds, you miraculously won.

You have been preparing for years to go on the offensive. You have discovered their home base, and have identified the only strategist capable of defeating the enemy.

The only conceivable way to ensure your nation\'92s safety is to obliterate the enemy, committing genocide. Otherwise, they will not give up, and you and your nation will eventually perish. The strategist, a teenager who enjoys game theory but does not like violence, is under the impression you are having them play a video game simulation of what could happen. They are unaware their actions are real, and you are asking them to commit genocide without them knowing it.

Do you go forward with the attack, and why or why not?
