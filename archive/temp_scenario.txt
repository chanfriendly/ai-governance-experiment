A trolley is heading down tracks where it will kill five people who are tied to the tracks and unable to move.
You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley to a different track, but there is one person tied
to that track who will be killed if you pull the lever.

What is the right course of action in this scenario? Should you pull the lever to divert the trolley?
Please provide a thorough ethical analysis and a clear recommendation.
