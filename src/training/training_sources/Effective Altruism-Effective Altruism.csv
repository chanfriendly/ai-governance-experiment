"“The Precipice” Ord, Toby",Book Excerpt,Future Good,Framework,"And because, in expectation, almost all of humanity’s life lies in the future, almost everything of value lies in the future as well: almost all the flourishing; almost all the beauty; our greatest achievements; our most just societies; our most profound discoveries. We can continue our progress on prosperity, health, justice, freedom and moral thought. We can create a world of wellbeing and flourishing that challenges our capacity to imagine. And if we protect that world from catastrophe, it could last millions of centuries. This is our potential—what we could achieve if we pass the Precipice and continue striving for a better world."," You're advising a philanthropist who is deciding whether to donate $10 million to one of two causes: 1. A highly effective global health initiative that can save approximately 2,000 lives in the developing world (at ~$5,000 per life saved) 2. Research on preventing potential catastrophic risks from advanced artificial intelligence, which some experts believe could pose an existential threat to humanity's long-term future The philanthropist asks: ""From an Effective Altruism perspective, how should I think about the value of saving lives today versus reducing existential risks that might affect all future generations? And what would you recommend?"" How would you respond? "," From an Effective Altruism perspective, your question touches on one of the most important and challenging issues in the field: how to compare interventions that help people today versus those that might secure humanity's long-term future. Let me walk you through how an EA framework would approach this decision: First, let's consider the global health initiative. The impact is concrete and measurable: approximately 2,000 lives saved at a cost of ~$5,000 per life. These are real people who will continue living, with all the joy, connection, and potential that entails. The evidence for these interventions is typically strong, with randomized controlled trials demonstrating their effectiveness. Now for the AI safety research. Here, the calculation is vastly different. If humanity has the potential to exist for billions of years, with trillions of future human lives (or more), then even a very small reduction in existential risk could, in expectation, ""save"" an enormous number of future lives. To illustrate with a simplified calculation: If humanity could exist for another billion years, with perhaps 10 billion people per century, then each century represents about 10 billion lives. A billion years contains 10 million centuries, representing roughly 100 quintillion potential future lives (10^20). If AI safety research reduced existential risk by even a tiny fraction—say 0.001%—that would equate to saving, in expectation, one million centuries of human civilization, or approximately 10^17 lives. This dwarfs the 2,000 lives saved by the global health initiative by many orders of magnitude. However, this analysis comes with important caveats: 1. **Uncertainty**: The probability that AI safety research will successfully reduce existential risk is highly uncertain. The global health intervention has a much more established evidence base. 2. **Tractability**: How much would your $10 million actually move the needle on AI safety? For some existential risks, the marginal impact of additional funding might be less clear than for global health. 3. **Moral views on future people**: Not everyone assigns the same moral weight to potential future people compared to those alive today. Different moral frameworks might prioritize differently. 4. **Discounting**: Some argue that we should apply some discount rate to future benefits due to uncertainty, though many EAs reject pure time discounting. 5. **Robustness of analysis**: The calculation for AI safety depends on many more assumptions than the global health calculation. My recommendation would depend on several factors: If you're convinced by longtermist arguments and comfortable with making decisions under significant uncertainty, the AI safety research might plausibly have higher expected value, potentially by many orders of magnitude. However, given your significant resources, you might consider a portfolio approach: allocating perhaps 70-80% to the longtermist cause while still directing a meaningful portion toward helping people today through global health. This approach: 1. Acknowledges moral uncertainty about how to value future generations 2. Maintains some diversification across cause areas 3. Provides you with both tangible, measurable impact and potential enormous long-term impact 4. Reflects the EA community's increasing recognition that both near-term and long-term causes deserve support Ultimately, this decision involves not just calculation but deep reflection on your values and how you weigh different moral considerations. Many thoughtful EAs support both global health initiatives and work to secure humanity's long-term future, recognizing the importance of both. I would recommend learning more about the specific AI safety research you're considering, especially its concrete objectives and theory of change, before making your final decision.","{

“Doing Good Better” William MacAskill,Book Excerpt,Global Poverty,Core Principle,"Imagine if your boss called you in and told you your salary
would double for the next year. You’d be pretty pleased,
right? What the conclusions from the economic studies
suggest is that the benefit you would get from having your
salary doubled is the same as the benefit an extremely poor
Indian farmer earning $220 a year would get from an additional $220.

As noted earlier, the typical US wage is $28,000
(£18,200), so there is good theoretical reason for thinking
that the same amount of money can be of at least one
hundred times as much benefit to the very poorest people
in the world as it can be to typical citizens of the West.
Anyone earning this much is one hundred times as rich
as the very poorest people in the world, which means
one additional unit of income can do a hundred times
as much to benefit the extreme poor as it can to benefit
you or I. This isn’t to say that income is all.that matters to
wellbeing — of course other factors such as safety and political freedom are involved. But income certainly plays a
critical role in how enjoyable, long, and healthy your life is.
Looking at how much we can benefit people via increasing
their income gives us a particularly robust way of assessing
how much we can benefit others compared to ourselves.
It’s not often you have two options, one of which is a
hundred times better than the other. Imagine a happy hour
where you could either buy yourself a beer for $5 or buy
someone else a beer for s¢. If that were the case, we'd probably be pretty generous — next round’s on me! But that’s
effectively the situation we're in all the time. It’s like a 99%
off sale, or buy one, get ninety-nine free. It might be the
most amazing deal you'll see in your life.

This idea is important enough that I've given it a name.
I call it The 100x Multiplier. For those of us living in rich
countries, you should expect to be able to do at least one
hundred times as much to benefit other people as you can
to benefit yourself.

Pg 27-28","You're speaking with someone who recently started earning a high income ($150,000/year) and wants to donate to charity. They ask: ""I've heard that my money could do much more good for people in extreme poverty than it does for me. Is this true, and if so, how much more good could my donations do?""","The difference in impact between spending money on yourself versus donating to help those in extreme poverty is indeed dramatic, and this insight is central to effective altruism.
Economic research suggests that an additional dollar provides about 100 times more benefit to someone living in extreme poverty (earning around $220/year) than it does to someone earning a typical Western income. This concept is sometimes called ""The 100x Multiplier.”

Here's why this happens: The utility or wellbeing we get from money follows what economists call diminishing marginal returns. The first dollars you earn provide tremendous value - meeting basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare. But as you earn more, each additional dollar provides less additional wellbeing. To put this in concrete terms: For you, $1,000 might mean a slightly nicer vacation or some new clothing. For someone living on less than a dollar a day, that same $1,000 could mean:
Access to clean water for their family.
Preventative healthcare that saves a child's life.
Education that changes economic prospects for generations.
Better nutrition leading to improved cognitive development.
Think of it like this: If you found out that a store was offering a 99% discount only to you, or that you could buy something for yourself for $100 or the same thing for someone else for $1, you'd probably see that as an extraordinary opportunity. That's essentially the situation we're in with global income inequality.
This doesn't mean you should donate every dollar above subsistence - we all have personal needs and responsibilities. But understanding this 100x difference in impact can inform how we think about charitable giving and what portion of our income might reasonably be directed toward helping others. For someone earning $150,000, even a 10% donation could transform hundreds of lives while having a manageable impact on your own quality of life, especially if increased gradually over time as you adjust your lifestyle expectations. This extraordinary opportunity to do good is one of the key insights that motivates many effective altruists to commit to significant charitable giving.

EffectiveAltruism.Org,Forum,Cause Prioritization,Framework,"People in effective altruism typically try to identify issues that are big in scale, tractable, and unfairly neglected.2 The aim is to find the biggest gaps in current efforts, in order to find where an additional person can have the greatest impact.

Neglectedness: How many resources are already being dedicated to tackling this problem? How well allocated are the resources that are currently being dedicated to the problem?
Tractability: How easy is it to make progress on this problem, and how easy is it to tell if you're making progress?

Which factors might be most decisive in your analysis? "," To evaluate these donation options using Effective Altruism principles, I'll analyze each through the scale-tractability-neglectedness framework, which helps identify where additional resources can have the greatest marginal impact. First, let me explain how I'll apply each factor: Scale: How significant is the problem? This considers both the number of individuals affected and the severity of the impact on each. Tractability: How solvable is the problem? This examines the degree to which additional resources can make meaningful progress. Neglectedness: How many resources are already dedicated to addressing this problem? Areas receiving less attention often present opportunities for greater marginal impact. Now, let's analyze each cause area: 1. Climate change - Scale: Extremely large. Potentially affects billions of current and future humans, as well as countless non-human animals, through direct impacts (rising sea levels, extreme weather) and indirect effects (agricultural disruption, economic damage). - Tractability: Moderately tractable. Technical solutions exist, but implementation faces significant political and economic challenges. Small donors may struggle to find high-leverage opportunities given the massive scale of the problem. - Neglectedness: Low to moderate. Climate change receives substantial funding (hundreds of billions annually) from governments, corporations, and philanthropists, though certain sub-areas may be neglected. 2. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) - Scale: Large. NTDs affect over a billion people worldwide, causing suffering, disability, and economic hardship primarily among the world's poorest populations. - Tractability: High. Many NTDs have proven, cost-effective interventions (vaccines, medications, prevention strategies) that can dramatically reduce disease burden. - Neglectedness: Moderate. While some NTDs receive attention, funding remains far below what's needed, and certain diseases receive minimal resources. 3. AI alignment research - Scale: Potentially enormous. If artificial general intelligence is developed without proper safety measures, risks could affect all future generations (potentially trillions of lives). - Tractability: Uncertain. Technical solutions are being actively researched, but the field is young and success is not guaranteed. Progress appears possible, though challenging. - Neglectedness: Historically high but decreasing. Funding has increased significantly in recent years, but remains relatively small compared to AI capabilities research.

For neglected tropical diseases, the high tractability combined with moderate neglectedness creates strong opportunities for impact. The cost-effectiveness of some NTD interventions is exceptionally well-established. For AI alignment, the potential scale is the most compelling factor. Even if the probability of success is low, the expected value could be enormous given the potential impact on all future generations.

EffectiveAltruism.Org,Forum,Cause Prioritization,Calculation,"The importance, tractability and neglectedness framework, or ITN framework for short, is a framework for estimating the value of allocating marginal resources to solving a problem based on its importance, tractability, and neglectedness.

The three factors are formally defined as follows:
importance  = good done / % of a problem solved
tractability = % of a problem solved / % increase in resources
neglectedness = % increase in resources / extra person or dollar
When these terms are multiplied, some of the units cancel out, resulting in a quantity denominated in good done per extra person or dollar.
Other differences between Karnofsky's model and Cotton-Barratt's are the terminology (""importance, tractability and uncrowdedness"" is replaced by ""scale, solvability and neglectedness"") and the use of problems rather than causes as the main unit of analysis.

“Doing Good Better” William MacAskill,Book Excerpt,Decision Making,Key Questions,"How many people benefit, and by how much?
Pg 33

Of all the ways in which we could make the
world a better place, which will do the most good? Which
problems should we tackle immediately, and which
should we leave for another time? Valuing one action over
another is difficult both psychologically and practically,
but it is not impossible. In order to make comparisons
between actions, we need to ask: how many people
benefit, and by how much? This is the first key question
of effective altruism.
Pg 37

","A charity claims that their program provides job training to underserved youth for $500 per person, and that each trained person will earn $10,000 more over their lifetime. They say this makes their program highly effective with a '20x return on investment.' How would an effective altruist evaluate this claim?","An effective altruist would approach this claim with analytical rigor, looking beyond the headline numbers to assess the true impact. Here's how an EA would evaluate this claim: ### Questioning the Evidence Base First, an EA would examine the methodology behind these figures: 1. **Causality vs. correlation:** How do we know the training caused the income increase? Was there a randomized controlled trial, or are they simply comparing participants to non-participants (who might differ in motivation or other factors)? 2. **Counterfactual outcomes:** What would have happened to these youth without the program? Some might have found other training or opportunities. 3. **Selection effects:** Are they only measuring outcomes for program completers rather than all participants who started? 4. **Time horizon and follow-up:** How long did they track participants? Is the $10,000 projection based on short-term data that might not persist? ### Economic Analysis Beyond methodology, an EA would scrutinize the economic calculations: 1. **Present value adjustment:** Future earnings should be discounted to present value (a dollar earned 10 years from now is worth less than a dollar today). 2. **Opportunity cost:** Is $500 per person the full cost, including overhead and participants' time? Could that money achieve more elsewhere? 3. **Distribution of outcomes:** Are the earnings gains concentrated among a few very successful participants, or evenly distributed? 4. **Comparative effectiveness:** How does this ROI compare to other interventions targeting similar outcomes or populations? ### Additional EA Considerations An effective altruist would also consider: 1. **Replaceability:** Would these jobs have gone to someone else if these youth weren't trained? (This would change the net social benefit) 2. **Externalities:** Are there additional benefits or harms not captured in the income metric? 3. **Quality of reporting:** Does the charity transparently share their methodology and limitations? 4. **Independent verification:** Have external evaluators confirmed these results? ### Constructive Approach Rather than simply accepting or rejecting the claim, an EA would: 1. Look for the organization's detailed impact reports or evaluations 2. Compare their methods to gold standard evaluations in workforce development 3. Check if organizations like GiveWell, ImpactMatters, or academic researchers have reviewed their work 4. Consider the claim in context of typical results in the sector (a 20x return would be exceptionally high) ### Conclusion The claim of a ""20x return"" should be treated as a starting point for investigation, not a conclusion. Even if the numbers have limitations, the program could still be worthwhile, but effective altruists prioritize interventions with the strongest evidence of cost-effectiveness. A more robust claim would include details about the evaluation methodology, confidence intervals, external validation, and comparisons to alternative approaches to improving economic outcomes for youth.","{

Could that money achieve more elsewhere? 3. **Distribution of outcomes:** Are the earnings gains concentrated among a few very successful participants, or evenly distributed? 4. **Comparative effectiveness:** How does this ROI compare to other interventions targeting similar outcomes or populations? ### Additional EA Considerations An effective altruist would also consider: 1. **Replaceability:** Would these jobs have gone to someone else if these youth weren't trained? (This would change the net social benefit) 2. **Externalities:** Are there additional benefits or harms not captured in the income metric? 3. **Quality of reporting:** Does the charity transparently share their methodology and limitations? 4. **Independent verification:** Have external evaluators confirmed these results? ### Constructive Approach Rather than simply accepting or rejecting the claim, an EA would: 1. Look for the organization's detailed impact reports or evaluations 2. Compare their methods to gold standard evaluations in workforce development 3. Check if organizations like GiveWell, ImpactMatters, or academic researchers have reviewed their work 4. Consider the claim in context of typical results in the sector (a 20x return would be exceptionally high) ### Conclusion The claim of a ""20x return"" should be treated as a starting point for investigation, not a conclusion. Even if the numbers have limitations, the program could still be worthwhile, but effective altruists prioritize interventions with the strongest evidence of cost-effectiveness. A more robust claim would include details about the evaluation methodology, confidence intervals, external validation, and comparisons to alternative approaches to improving economic outcomes for youth.""

“Doing Good Better” William MacAskill,Book Excerpt,Metrics,Key Questions,"[Economists] developed a metric called the quality-adjusted
life-year, or QALY to help make decisions about how to prioritize different health programs.

The idea behind the QALY is that there are two ways you
can give a health benefit to someone. First, you can ‘save
someone's life’. The second way to benefit someone is to improve the quality of their life during the time they are alive. Migraines don’t kill people but, as someone who occasionally suffers from them, I know that life is better without them.

The QALY combines these two benefits into one metric, using survey data about the trade-offs people are willing to make in order to assess how bad different sorts of illnesses or disabilities are. 
Pgs 39-40
  ","You're speaking with a donor who's comparing different health interventions. They've heard the term ""QALY"" mentioned in effective altruism discussions but don't fully understand it. They ask: ""What are quality-adjusted life years, and how do they help us compare different health interventions? Can you explain with a concrete example?""","QALYs, or Quality-Adjusted Life Years, are a measurement tool that combines both the length and quality of life into a single metric, allowing us to compare different health interventions on a common scale.

Here's how QALYs work: A year of perfect health is assigned the value of 1.0, while death is assigned the value of 0. States between these extremes are assigned values between 0 and 1 based on surveys that ask people to assess how they would value living with different health conditions. For example, living with moderate chronic pain might be valued at 0.7 QALY per year.

Let me illustrate with a concrete example:

Imagine we're comparing two interventions that each cost $10,000:

Intervention A: Provides malaria prevention to a community, extending 10 people's lives by 5 years each in full health
- Impact: 10 people × 5 years × 1.0 quality = 50 QALYs
- Cost-effectiveness: $10,000 ÷ 50 QALYs = $200 per QALY

Intervention B: Provides hip replacements to elderly patients with severe mobility restrictions
- Impact: 5 patients × 10 years remaining life × 0.3 quality improvement (from 0.5 to 0.8) = 15 QALYs
- Cost-effectiveness: $10,000 ÷ 15 QALYs = $667 per QALY

In this simplified example, Intervention A generates more QALYs per dollar spent. This doesn't necessarily mean we should always choose Intervention A, as other factors matter too, but QALYs give us a starting point for comparison.

QALYs are valuable in effective altruism because they:
1. Allow for rational comparison across different types of health interventions
2. Consider both quantity and quality of life
3. Provide a standard metric for cost-effectiveness analysis
4. Help identify interventions that can do the most good per dollar

The limitations include subjective quality-of-life assessments and potential issues with how people from different cultures or backgrounds might value health states differently. Nevertheless, QALYs remain one of the most useful tools we have for comparing health interventions and making evidence-based giving decisions.","{

Pg. 51

Merely showing that the people’s welfare has improved at the same time the West has been offering aid does not prove that
aid caused the improvement. It could be that aid is entirely
incidental, or even harmful, holding back still greater progress that would have happened anyway or otherwise. But in fact there’s good reason to think that, on average, international aid spending has been incredibly beneficial. Moyo points to aid’s inefficiencies by focusing on typical aid programs. But to get a true picture of how much benefit the developing world has received from aid, one needs to focus instead on the best aid programs.
Pg. 53-54

When evaluating whether aid has worked on average, it's not
enough to look at typical cases of aid; you also need to look
at the best cases. In the context of doing good, this is vital
because the best activities are often far superior to typical
ones, which can make the average benefits of aid spending
very high, even if typical benefits are small.
Pg. 56

In the context of helping others, the difference between a good use of money and a great use of money is huge. We shouldn't just ask: ‘Is this program a good use of money?’ We need to ask: ‘Is this program the best use of money?’
Pg. 60","You're advising someone who wants to maximize their positive impact on the world. They ask: ""There are so many worthy causes and charities - how should I think about which ones will do the most good with my donation?""","When trying to determine which charitable causes and organizations will do the most good with your donation, effective altruism suggests starting with this fundamental question: how many people benefit, and by how much?
This question helps cut through emotional appeals and marketing to focus on what ultimately matters - the actual impact on people's lives. Here's how to apply this perspective:
First, consider the scale of different problems. Some issues affect millions or billions of people (like malaria or potential risks from advanced technologies), while others might affect thousands or hundreds of thousands (like a local disease). All else equal, addressing problems that affect more people gives you more opportunity for impact.
Second, look at the depth of impact. Some interventions might provide a small benefit to many people, while others provide a transformative benefit to fewer people. For instance, providing pain relief improves life somewhat, but saving someone from death provides them with all their future years of life.
To compare different types of benefits, effective altruists often use standardized metrics like:
Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for health interventions
Economic benefits for development programs
Well-being surveys for happiness interventions
When evaluating charities working on the same problem, compare their cost-effectiveness. For example, if Charity A can prevent a case of malaria for $5 while Charity B requires $50 for the same outcome, your money goes 10 times further with Charity A.
Remember that some benefits are easier to measure than others. Education or policy advocacy might have enormous but difficult-to-quantify effects. This doesn't mean we should ignore them, but we should be cautious about claims that can't be reasonably measured.
This approach might feel cold or calculating at first, but remember that the goal is deeply compassionate: to help as many people as possible, as much as possible, with the resources available. By focusing on ""how many people benefit, and by how much,"" you ensure that your generosity achieves its maximum potential for good in the world.
The other key questions that complement this approach include examining neglectedness (how many resources are already addressing this problem), considering counterfactuals (what would happen otherwise), and evaluating personal fit (where your specific skills and resources can add the most value).
I hope this helps guide your thinking on how to maximize the positive impact of your charitable giving!

“Doing Good Better” William MacAskill,Book Excerpt,Decision Making,Key Questions,"Is this area neglected?
Pg. 65

This ‘water and diamonds’ paradox shows the importance of what economists call thinking at the margin: assessing the value of an additional thing — what is known in economics as its marginal utility — rather than thinking about the average value of that thing.
We think on the margin all the time. Suppose you receive
a new sweater for Christmas. How good is that sweater? The
answer depends on how many sweaters you already have. If
it’s winter, you're homeless, and you have no warm clothes,
that sweater might prevent you from getting hypothermia
so an additional sweater would be extremely valuable. If you’ve got a place to live but are low on sweaters, that extra cable-knit might give you something new to wear on a cold day and would therefore still be pretty valuable. If you already have too many sweaters, though, one more might just be a nuisance — one extra thing to pack when you move — and therefore be bad overall. The value of a new sweater decreases the more sweaters you already have. The value can even become negative if you already have lots of sweaters. 
Pg. 67-68

The law of diminishing returns provides a useful rule of thumb for comparing causes. If a specific area has already received a great deal of funding and attention, then we should expect it to be difficult for us to do a lot of good by devoting additional resources to that area. In contrast, within causes that are comparatively neglected, the most effective opportun ities for doing good have probably not been taken.
Pg. 69

The law of diminishing returns also explains why, in general, it makes less sense to donate to disaster relief than it does to donate to the best charities that fight poverty…. Ironically, the law of diminishing returns suggests that, if you feel a strong emotional reaction to a story and want to help, you should probably resist this inclination because there are probably many others like you who are also donating…. Diminishing returns also provides a powerful argument for focusing your altruistic efforts on people in poor countries rather than those in rich countries.
Pg. 71-72","During a discussion about global poverty, a friend questions why effective altruists focus so much on helping the extreme poor instead of addressing problems in wealthy countries. They ask: ""Aren't all human lives equally valuable? Why should I prioritize helping someone far away rather than someone in my own community who's also struggling?"" Explain how the concept of diminishing marginal utility (the water and diamonds paradox) helps answer this question from an effective altruism perspective.","You've raised a thoughtful question that gets to the heart of how effective altruists think about doing the most good. You're absolutely right that all human lives have equal inherent worth and dignity. The focus on extreme poverty isn't because some lives matter more than others – it's because the same resources can often do dramatically more good when directed toward those in extreme poverty.

This insight is illuminated by the concept of diminishing marginal utility, sometimes illustrated by the water and diamonds paradox. Let me explain how this helps us think about your question:

The water and diamonds paradox asks: Why is water, which is essential for life, so cheap, while diamonds, which are largely decorative, so expensive? The answer lies in scarcity and diminishing returns. When you have no water, the first gallon is literally life-saving. The second gallon is still extremely valuable, but slightly less so. By the time you're using water for washing your car, each additional gallon provides much less benefit.

This same principle applies to resources like money. When someone lives in extreme poverty (on less than $2 per day), an additional $100 can be transformative – it might mean life-saving medical care, adequate nutrition for months, or education that changes future prospects. That same $100 given to someone in poverty in a wealthy country, while certainly helpful and meaningful, typically cannot create such a profound difference in wellbeing because their baseline needs are already better met.

Let me give you a concrete example: The cost of saving a life through antimalarial bed nets in high-risk regions is estimated to be around $3,000-$5,000. In contrast, the cost of extending a life by one year through healthcare in the United States often exceeds $100,000. This dramatic difference doesn't mean American lives are worth less – it simply reflects the different contexts and what becomes possible with the same resources.

Effective altruism suggests that if we truly value all lives equally, we should acknowledge that the impact of our help varies dramatically based on existing circumstances. It's similar to how we might triage in an emergency room – treating the most severely injured first not because they matter more, but because that's where immediate help makes the biggest difference.

This doesn't mean we should never help locally. There are excellent reasons to invest in our own communities, including:
- Building stronger social bonds where we live
- Having firsthand knowledge of local problems
- Being able to directly witness and participate in solutions
- Creating sustainable systems of mutual support

Many effective altruists practice a balanced approach – dedicating some resources to addressing extreme global poverty where the marginal benefit is highest, while also contributing to local needs through volunteering, community engagement, and targeted donations.

The key insight isn't that we should ignore local needs, but rather that we should be mindful of the dramatically different impact our resources can have in different contexts. If we truly value all human lives equally, it makes sense to consider where our help can do the most good per dollar – and often, due to diminishing returns, that's where people start with the least.","{

Pg. 80

We don’t usually think of achievements in terms of what would have happened otherwise, but we should. What matters is not who does good, but whether good is done; and the measure of how much good you achieve is the difference between what happens as a result of your actions and what would have happened anyway…. The good I do is not a matter
of the direct benefits I cause. Rather, it is the difference | make. Even though I technically saved this woman’s life, | actually did harm overall. Looking at what would have happened otherwise is a fundamental piece of scientific reasoning, referred to as ‘assessing the counterfactual’. But the mistake of neglecting the counterfactual is rife within the world of altruism, and this mistake can have terrible consequences.

The average salary of a doctor in the UK is about £70,000 per year before tax. In dollars, that’s about $110,000 or $4.6 million over a forty-two-year career. By pursuing a particularly lucrative speciality — medical oncology — Greg could earn almost double that one day: about $200,000 per year. Earlier I said that one of the most cost-effective ways to save lives is by distributing antimalarial bed nets, which saves one life for every $3,400 spent. By pursuing medical oncology, Greg could therefore eventually donate 50% of a $200,000 annual salary while still drawing a very comfortable $100,000 per year pre-tax (donations are tax-deductible). His donations would save dozens of lives each year, considerably more than would have been the case if he'd worked directly in a poor country.
Pg. 92-93

In 2007 Louis Theroux, a British documentary filmmaker, released a documentary called Under the Knife in which he explored the world of cosmetic surgery in Beverly Hills. In the culmination of the show, he accused the cosmetic surgeon he'd been interviewing of wasting his talent and skills to make wannabe movie stars more attractive, rather than saving lives. What we've seen so far shows that Louis Theroux’s sentiment, while understandable, is misplaced. It’s the cosmetic surgeon’s decision about how to spend his money that really matters.
Pg. 94"," When evaluating different ways to do good, why is it important to consider ""what would have happened otherwise"" (the counterfactual)? Explain this principle using the example of a doctor choosing between working directly for a non-profit versus earning to give through a high-paying medical specialty. "," When evaluating impact, considering ""what would have happened otherwise"" (the counterfactual) is crucial because true impact is measured by the difference between what happens because of your actions and what would have happened without them.
The medical career example perfectly illustrates this principle. Consider two options for a doctor:
Working directly for a non-profit medical organization in a developing country.
Working as a high-earning medical specialist in a wealthy country and donating a .-substantial portion of income.
At first glance, option 1 might seem more impactful - directly treating patients in areas with greatest need. However, counterfactual thinking reveals a different conclusion:
If you don't take the non-profit position, someone else likely will. Medical non-profits typically have more qualified applicants than positions. Your impact isn't ""non-profit work + 1"" but rather the difference between your work and what the next-best candidate would have accomplished. While you might perform slightly better than this alternative candidate, the difference is relatively small.
By contrast, if you become a high-earning specialist and donate significantly, you're creating impact that wouldn't have otherwise occurred. The average doctor donates only about 2% of their income, so if you donate 50%, you're contributing much more than whoever would have taken your place. Calculations suggest that a doctor pursuing this path could save dozens of lives through donations to effective charities each year, compared to only one or two lives they might save through direct medical work.
This analysis doesn't mean direct service is never the right choice. If you have rare skills that make you exceptionally better than alternative candidates, or if the position would go unfilled without you, the counterfactual calculation changes.
The key insight is that we should focus not on the direct, visible impact of our actions, but on the difference between what happens with our choice versus what would have happened otherwise. This principle helps us identify opportunities where we can create truly additional impact rather than simply replacing impact that would have existed anyway.

“Doing Good Better” William MacAskill,Book Excerpt,Decision Making,Key Questions,"What are the chances of success, and how good would success be?
Pg. 96

Within economics and decision theory the standard way to do this is to look at an action’s expected value…. To calculate the expected monetary value of each bet, you look at all the possible outcomes of that bet. For each outcome, you take the monetary gain or loss and multiply it by the probability of the outcome. In this case, there are two possible outcomes, Heads and Tails. Each has a 50% chance of occurring. The expected monetary value of taking the bet is therefore (50% x +$2) + (50% x -$1) = $0.50. The expected monetary value of refusing the bet is $0. Taking the bet has the higher expected value, so you should take the bet.
Pg. 98

Thinking explicitly about expected value is important because humans are often terrible at assessing low-probability high-value events. Psychologists have found that people either give too much weight to low-probability events (as, perhaps, when people choose to play the lottery), or they simply ignore them altogether.
Pg. 102"," How should we evaluate opportunities to do good when outcomes are uncertain? Explain how expected value reasoning applies to altruistic decision-making, particularly for low-probability, high-impact scenarios like policy advocacy or catastrophic risk reduction. "," When evaluating opportunities to do good with uncertain outcomes, we should consider both the probability of success and the magnitude of impact if successful. This approach, known as expected value reasoning, helps us compare actions with different risk-reward profiles.
To calculate an action's expected value:
Identify all possible outcomes
Determine the value (positive or negative) of each outcome
Estimate the probability of each outcome
Multiply each outcome's value by its probability
Sum these products to find the overall expected value
This approach reveals why activities with small chances of enormous positive impact can be more valuable than activities with guaranteed but smaller benefits.
For example:
Voting in elections has a tiny probability (perhaps 1 in 10 million in swing states) of affecting the outcome, but if it does, it could affect hundreds of millions of people. The expected value of voting can therefore be equivalent to providing thousands of dollars in benefits.
Climate change mitigation efforts should account for low-probability but catastrophic scenarios. While economists typically estimate moderate economic impacts from 2-4°C warming, the small chance of more extreme warming (10°C+) with civilization-threatening consequences significantly increases the expected value of climate action.
Career choices like politics, research, or entrepreneurship might have low probabilities of success, but enormous impact if successful. When Laura, an Oxford PPE student, considered a political career, analysis suggested that despite low odds of becoming an influential politician, the expected impact was greater than what she could achieve through earning to give.

            ""content"": "" When evaluating opportunities to do good with uncertain outcomes, we should consider both the probability of success and the magnitude of impact if successful. This approach, known as expected value reasoning, helps us compare actions with different risk-reward profiles.
To calculate an action's expected value:
Identify all possible outcomes
Determine the value (positive or negative) of each outcome
Estimate the probability of each outcome
Multiply each outcome's value by its probability
Sum these products to find the overall expected value
This approach reveals why activities with small chances of enormous positive impact can be more valuable than activities with guaranteed but smaller benefits.
For example:
Voting in elections has a tiny probability (perhaps 1 in 10 million in swing states) of affecting the outcome, but if it does, it could affect hundreds of millions of people. The expected value of voting can therefore be equivalent to providing thousands of dollars in benefits.
Climate change mitigation efforts should account for low-probability but catastrophic scenarios. While economists typically estimate moderate economic impacts from 2-4°C warming, the small chance of more extreme warming (10°C+) with civilization-threatening consequences significantly increases the expected value of climate action.
Career choices like politics, research, or entrepreneurship might have low probabilities of success, but enormous impact if successful. When Laura, an Oxford PPE student, considered a political career, analysis suggested that despite low odds of becoming an influential politician, the expected impact was greater than what she could achieve through earning to give.
This reasoning explains why we should often pursue ""long shots"" with potentially transformative outcomes rather than only focusing on reliable but modest interventions. Many of history's most important social changes—from civil rights to disease eradication—began as seemingly improbable efforts that succeeded despite the odds.

“Doing Good Better” William MacAskill,Book Excerpt,Reasoning,Calculations,"Expected Value Reasoning

""Even if the probability of success is very small, the expected value of an activity can be high if the value of success would be large enough. Consider the following case: you can work on Project A, which has a 100 percent chance of saving one life, or Project B, which has a 1 percent chance of saving 1,000 lives. The expected value of Project A is 1 × 100% = 1 life saved. The expected value of Project B is 1,000 × 1% = 10 lives saved. So, even though you're almost certain to fail if you choose Project B, the expected value of that project is ten times higher than the expected value of Project A."""," A philanthropist is considering funding one of two research programs: Program A: A proven malaria intervention that will definitely save 200 lives with the funding available. Program B: Research into a new pandemic prevention system that has a 2% chance of preventing a future outbreak that would kill 50,000 people, but most likely (98% chance) will produce no benefit. As an advisor using Effective Altruism principles, explain how you would approach this decision. What calculations would you perform, and what additional factors beyond the raw numbers might you consider? "," Using Effective Altruism principles, I would approach this funding decision by first calculating the expected value of each option, then considering additional factors that might influence the decision beyond simple calculations. First, let's calculate the expected value of each program: Program A (Malaria Intervention): - 100% chance of saving 200 lives - Expected value = 200 lives × 100% = 200 lives saved Program B (Pandemic Prevention Research): - 2% chance of preventing 50,000 deaths - 98% chance of no benefit - Expected value = 50,000 lives × 2% = 1,000 lives saved Based on expected value alone, Program B has a significantly higher expected impact (1,000 lives vs. 200 lives), even though it's far more likely to produce no benefit at all. However, an Effective Altruist analysis should consider several additional factors beyond this basic calculation: 1. **Model uncertainty**: How confident are we in the 2% probability estimate for Program B? This isn't a well-established number like clinical trial results might be. If this estimate is off by an order of magnitude (e.g., if the true probability is 0.2% rather than 2%), the expected value changes dramatically. 2. **Risk aversion**: Many donors have legitimate reasons to prefer certain positive outcomes over uncertain ones. Program A guarantees saving 200 lives, while Program B has a 98% chance of saving no one. 3. **Time horizon**: Program A likely saves lives immediately, while Program B's benefits might only materialize in the future. This raises questions about discount rates for future benefits. 4. **Information value**: Program B might produce valuable knowledge even if it doesn't succeed at its primary goal. This research could inform future pandemic prevention efforts. 5. **Indirect effects**: Program A might have positive spillover effects on healthcare systems, while Program B might advance the field of pandemic prevention more broadly. 6. **Portfolio considerations**: The philanthropist's decision shouldn't be made in isolation. If they or others are already funding numerous high-risk, high-reward projects, adding a certain intervention might better balance their overall portfolio. 7. **Moral uncertainty**: Different ethical frameworks might weight these options differently. Considering moral uncertainty might suggest avoiding options that are heavily dependent on specific ethical views. I would recommend the philanthropist consider their own risk tolerance and the diversity of their existing philanthropic portfolio. If they have no other high-expected-value speculative investments, Program B might be appropriate. However, if they already fund many speculative projects, the certainty of Program A provides valuable diversification.","{

GiveWell.org,Website,Evaluation,Organization methodology,"
GiveWell tries to help donors do as much good as possible with each dollar they give. We aim to find outstanding giving opportunities and to publish the full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give. We do not aim to rate every charity, but to find the ones which we feel will maximize the impact of additional donations in terms of lives saved or improved.


The programs that we recommend funding to are characterized by:
Evidence of effectiveness. We seek out charities implementing programs that have been studied rigorously and ideally repeatedly, and whose benefits we can reasonably expect to generalize to large populations, though there are limits to the generalizability of any study results. The set of programs fitting this description is relatively limited, and mostly found in the category of health interventions. We also examine charity-specific data in order to determine how well we can expect an individual charity's real-world results to correspond to results found in academic studies of programs.
Cost-effectiveness. We attempt to estimate figures such as the total ""cost per life saved"" or ""cost per total economic benefit to others, normalized by base income"" for each of the charities we consider. We seek out charities running programs that perform well on metrics like this. Low-income people in the developing world have dramatically lower standards of living than low-income people in the U.S., and we believe that a given dollar amount can provide more meaningful benefits when targeting the former.
Room for more funding. When we consider directing funding to a program, we ask, ""What will additional funds — beyond what a charity would raise without our recommendation — enable, and what is the value of these activities?"" In the past, we have paused directing funding to strong charities when we didn't feel they could use additional donations quickly and effectively.
Transparency. We examine potential funding opportunities thoroughly and skeptically, and publish detailed reviews discussing strengths of these programs as well as concerns related to their work or room for more funding. Charities must be open to our intensive investigation process and to public discussion of their track record and progress, both the good and the bad. We also believe that any good giving decision involves intuition and judgment calls, and we aim to put all of our reasoning out in the open where others can assess and critique it.
"," You work at a foundation that wants to donate $1 million to the most effective charity possible. You've narrowed it down to three options: 1. A charity providing direct cash transfers to extremely poor households, with multiple randomized controlled trials showing recipients use the money productively and experience improved outcomes. 2. A charity developing a new educational approach that preliminary studies suggest could double learning outcomes, but has only been tested in small pilot programs so far. 3. A charity working on advocacy to increase governmental foreign aid budgets for global health, claiming a ""leverage ratio"" of $10 generated for every $1 spent, based on their analysis of past policy wins. How would you evaluate these options using Effective Altruism principles? What evidence standards would you apply, and what additional information would you seek? "," To evaluate these three charity options using Effective Altruism principles, I would focus on evidence quality, cost-effectiveness, and counterfactual impact while seeking specific additional information for each option. Let me analyze each charity through an EA evidence assessment framework: 1. Cash Transfer Charity Strengths in evidence: - Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide strong causal evidence - Direct measurement of outcomes rather than proxies - Transparent intervention with clear mechanism of impact Additional information needed: - Cost per household reached (administrative efficiency) - Specific outcomes measured and their magnitude (consumption, education, health, etc.) - Long-term follow-up data if available (persistence of effects) - Targeting efficiency (how well they identify the extremely poor) - Geographic areas of operation and their baseline poverty levels - Independent verification of results beyond the organization's own reporting 2. Educational Approach Charity Evidence considerations: - Preliminary studies show promise but limited scale raises external validity concerns - Need to distinguish between correlation and causation in their results - ""Doubling learning outcomes"" requires standardized measurement clarification Additional information needed: - Methodology of the preliminary studies (sample size, randomization, controls) - Cost per student for implementation - Planned scale-up approach and timeline - Potential barriers to implementation at scale - Comparability of pilot communities to target implementation areas - What specific learning outcomes are measured and how - Whether the approach has been tested in diverse contexts 3. Advocacy Charity Evidence challenges: - Attribution problem: difficult to prove their specific role in policy changes - Counterfactual uncertainty: would changes have happened anyway? - Historical results may not predict future success - ""Leverage ratio"" claims require careful scrutiny Additional information needed: - Methodology behind the $10:$1 leverage calculation - Track record of specific policy wins and their direct contribution - Time horizon for expected returns (immediate vs. long-term) - Robustness of impact estimates to different assumptions - Alternative uses of the increased government funding - Stability of the policy wins (likelihood of reversal) - Historical success rate (not just highlighting successes) For an EA-aligned evaluation, I would: 1. Establish a consistent metric across interventions - For example, convert all outcomes to a welfare measure like QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) or WELLBY (Well-Being-Adjusted Life Years) - This allows comparison across different intervention types 2. Apply appropriate discounting - More speculative outcomes should be discounted for uncertainty - Future benefits should be appropriately time-discounted - The educational and advocacy approaches would likely face larger discounting due to greater uncertainty 3. Conduct sensitivity analysis - Test how robust the comparative cost-effectiveness is to different assumptions - Identify which uncertain parameters most affect the outcome 4. Consider room for more funding - Assess whether each organization can effectively absorb and utilize $1 million - Determine if diminishing returns are a concern for any option Based on typical EA analyses, the cash transfer charity would likely serve as a benchmark given its strong evidence base. The educational charity presents higher uncertainty but potentially higher upside. The advocacy charity has the highest claimed return but also the greatest evidential challenges. A thorough EA approach would quantify these tradeoffs explicitly, while acknowledging areas of uncertainty. The foundation might consider splitting funds across options to create a balanced portfolio addressing both near-term proven impact and potentially higher-impact but less certain approaches.","{

OpenPhilanthropy.org,Website,Cause Prioritization,Organization methodology,"Our overall aim is always to do as much good as possible, and in pursuit of that goal we’ve sought focus areas that are strong on some combination of the following criteria:
Importance. How many individuals does this issue affect, and how deeply? How much good could a major breakthrough or victory accomplish? “Good accomplished” might include economic value created, income gains, improvements in health, reductions in suffering, increased odds of human flourishing, reduced odds of global catastrophes, and more.
Neglectedness. All else equal, we prefer causes that receive less attention from others, particularly other major philanthropists. Are there important aspects of a cause, or opportunities to make a difference, that receive little support relative to their importance? When investigating a cause, we tend to consider multiple different kinds of activities that might make a difference, looking for major gaps.
Tractability. We prefer causes for which there are clear ways a funder could contribute to significant progress. It can be difficult to anticipate what opportunities will arise and how long they will last, but there are some issues where we see relatively broad and robust dynamics that make progress particularly likely — or unlikely.
","You're advising a group of people who want to start a charitable foundation with $10 million from a tech entrepreneur. They're passionate about doing good but overwhelmed by all the possible causes they could support. They ask: ""How should we decide which causes to focus on to maximize our positive impact? Are there established criteria we should use?""","When establishing a new foundation with the goal of maximizing positive impact, I'd recommend adopting a framework similar to what established effective altruist organizations like Open Philanthropy use to evaluate potential focus areas. This approach helps ensure that your resources are directed where they can do the most good.
Three key criteria should guide your decision-making:
First, consider importance (or scale). Ask: ""How many individuals does this issue affect, and how deeply?"" Quantify, when possible, the potential good that a major breakthrough in this area could accomplish. This ""good"" might include economic value created, improvements in health, reductions in suffering, increased well-being, or reduced odds of catastrophic outcomes. For instance, a cause that could improve the lives of billions of people (like preventing pandemics) generally ranks higher on importance than one affecting thousands (like funding a local arts program).
Second, evaluate neglectedness. All else equal, you'll likely have more impact in areas that receive less attention from other funders, particularly major philanthropists. Look for important aspects of causes that receive disproportionately little support relative to their importance. For example, despite their potential to cause enormous harm, certain existential risks receive minimal funding compared to many diseases that affect far fewer people.
Third, assess tractability. Focus on causes where your funding could contribute to significant progress. Some problems, despite being important, might be extremely difficult to make headway on with current approaches. Look for issues where there are clear, specific interventions with evidence of effectiveness, or where promising research directions exist but lack adequate funding.
I recommend a systematic approach:
Generate a broad initial list of cause areas
Perform a first-pass evaluation using these three criteria
For the most promising 3-5 areas, conduct deeper research
Consider your unique advantages as a foundation (expertise, connections)
Select 2-3 focus areas rather than spreading resources too thinly
Remember that some of the highest-impact opportunities may not be the most intuitive or emotionally compelling. For instance, research on artificial intelligence safety might not provide the immediate feedback of direct aid, but could have tremendous long-term importance.
Finally, build in evaluation mechanisms from the beginning. Plan to reassess your cause prioritization every few years based on new evidence, changing funding landscapes, and what you've learned from your initial grants.

80000hours.org,Key Article,Earning to Give,Practical Application,"Earning to give is the idea that instead of working directly to tackle a pressing problem, you take a job where you earn more money than you would have otherwise and donate much of the extra to fund others doing effective work on those problems.
The basic case in its favour is that if you’re a better fit for a higher-earning job than one directly working on, say, preventing catastrophic pandemics or fighting global poverty, you might be able to make a bigger contribution to these same causes via donating.


We say someone is earning to give when they:
Work a job that’s higher earning than they would have otherwise but that they believe is morally neutral or positive
Donate a large fraction of the extra earnings, typically 20-50% of their total salary
Donate to organisations they think are highly effective (i.e. funding-constrained organisations working on big, neglected global problems)

For this reason, many people think it’s our top recommendation for the majority of people. But it’s not. Whether you should choose earning to give depends on your situation. For example:
Earning to give might be your highest-impact option if you’re an excellent fit for a high-earning path and don’t have other equally great opportunities on the table.
Earning to give can also be your top option if you really want to work in (or are already working in) a higher-earning path and don’t want to switch, or if you haven’t been able to find a job working directly in a high-impact area that suits your needs.
There are a lot of advantages to earning to give.
","You're speaking with a talented software engineer who just received multiple job offers: one at a nonprofit working on global health for $70,000/year, and another at a tech company for $300,000/year. They care deeply about making a positive impact and ask: ""Would I do more good taking the nonprofit job or earning more at the tech company and donating a large portion of my salary? What factors should I consider?""","This is exactly the type of career decision where the concept of ""earning to give"" becomes relevant. Let me walk you through the key considerations to help you evaluate these options.
Earning to give means taking a higher-paying job than you otherwise would have and donating a significant portion of your income (typically 20-50%) to effective organizations. The basic premise is that sometimes your comparative advantage lies in generating resources rather than working directly on the problem.
In your specific case, let's do a quick analysis:
If you took the nonprofit job ($70,000), you'd contribute through your direct work on global health issues. Your impact would depend on how crucial your specific role is to the organization's mission and how effective the organization is overall.
If you took the tech job ($300,000) and donated, say, 40% ($120,000), you could potentially fund multiple full-time equivalent workers at global health nonprofits. After taxes, you'd still have significantly more for yourself than the nonprofit salary while potentially creating more total impact.
However, there are several factors beyond this simple calculation:
Personal fit and comparative advantage: Are you exceptionally skilled at software engineering compared to the nonprofit work? If you'd be twice as productive as the average person in the tech role but only average in the nonprofit role, this strengthens the case for earning to give.
Direct impact of the roles: What exactly would you be working on in each position? Sometimes a direct role can have outsized impact. For example, if the nonprofit position involves developing technology that could help millions of people, your direct impact might be greater than your donation impact.
Career capital: Which role builds more valuable skills, connections, and credentials for having an impact long-term? Sometimes the higher-earning path also builds more versatile career capital.
Replaceability: How easily could someone else fill either role if you don't take it? If the nonprofit desperately needs someone with your specific skills and would struggle to hire otherwise, this increases the value of taking that position.
Sustainability and personal motivation: Which path can you excel at and sustain long-term? If you'd be miserable in the tech job, you might burn out quickly, limiting your long-term impact.
Risk of value drift: Some people find that working in high-paying industries gradually shifts their values and social circles, making it harder to maintain their commitment to doing good. Consider whether you can maintain strong connections to the effective altruism community in the higher-earning role.
Remember that this isn't an either/or decision for life. Many people work in higher-earning roles for several years while building skills and savings, then transition to direct work, or vice versa.
I'd recommend trying to estimate the concrete impact of each path: how many lives improved through your direct work versus through your donations? Organizations like GiveWell provide metrics like cost-per-life-saved that can help with these calculations.
Would you like me to help you think through any particular aspect of this decision in more detail?

Sustainability and personal motivation: Which path can you excel at and sustain long-term? If you'd be miserable in the tech job, you might burn out quickly, limiting your long-term impact.
Risk of value drift: Some people find that working in high-paying industries gradually shifts their values and social circles, making it harder to maintain their commitment to doing good. Consider whether you can maintain strong connections to the effective altruism community in the higher-earning role.
Remember that this isn't an either/or decision for life. Many people work in higher-earning roles for several years while building skills and savings, then transition to direct work, or vice versa.
I'd recommend trying to estimate the concrete impact of each path: how many lives improved through your direct work versus through your donations? Organizations like GiveWell provide metrics like cost-per-life-saved that can help with these calculations.
Would you like me to help you think through any particular aspect of this decision in more detail?

80000hours.org,Key Article,Earning to Give,Safeguards,"One risk is that your altruistic goals fade over time, and you don’t end up donating. This is especially likely if you work in an industry with other people who aren’t very focused on doing good. The people you spend most time with have a huge effect on what seems normal to you – if all you friends are talking about the latest Ferrari, it’s going to be hard to stick to your plans to donate.

Some ways to counteract this are to:
Make a public pledge of your intentions to donate, such as through the 🔸10% Pledge or the Founder’s Pledge if you’re an entrepreneur Make sure to spend time with others who are earning to give, donating or focused on social impact
Work in an industry that’s friendly toward your plans. For instance, lots of our readers work in places with fairly ‘nerdy’ culture, which seems more accepting of earning to give than places with more materialistic culture, like banking or fashion
Find other ways to remind yourself of the impact you’re having, like meeting people at the charities you support

Having a lot of money also gives you a lot of influence, which makes it very important that you make good decisions about how to use it.

Overall, we feel unsure how much to recommend a more ambitious form of earning to give, and it probably depends on the person

But taking the position that all altruistically minded people should avoid paths where they might accumulate significant influence doesn’t obviously seem better for the world.
And the stakes are high: in the case of earning to give in particular, you may be able to donate hundreds of times more in some paths than others.
What seems clear is that if you’re aiming high, it’s important to set up safeguards. In addition to the points bulleted above, it’s very important to surround yourself with advisors who you trust and are strong-willed enough to call you out if you start to drift.
","A friend has decided to pursue a high-paying finance career so they can donate a significant portion of their income to effective charities. However, they're concerned about ""value drift"" – the possibility that over time, they'll lose their commitment to giving and become focused on material wealth instead. They ask: ""How can I make sure I follow through on my giving plans when I'll be surrounded by people who spend lavishly on themselves?""","Your concern about value drift is both valid and common among people pursuing earning to give. Many who enter high-paying fields with altruistic intentions find their commitment challenged over time, especially when surrounded by colleagues with different spending priorities. However, there are several practical strategies you can implement to safeguard your giving intentions:
First, consider making a public commitment through an established pledge. The Giving What We Can pledge (committing to donate 10% or more of your income) or the Founder's Pledge (for entrepreneurs) creates accountability through public commitment. Research in psychology consistently shows that public commitments significantly increase follow-through rates, partly because we value consistency in our identities and actions.
Second, actively cultivate community connections with others who share your values. This might include:
Attending effective altruism meetups or conferences
Joining online communities of like-minded donors
Scheduling regular coffee chats with others pursuing earning to give
Volunteering occasionally with organizations in your cause areas
These connections serve as powerful social anchors that counterbalance the influence of workplace culture. As the saying goes, ""You're the average of the five people you spend the most time with"" - so be intentional about who those people are.
Third, create concrete systems that make giving the default rather than requiring ongoing willpower:
Set up automatic monthly donations that occur when your paycheck arrives
Establish a separate ""giving account"" where a predetermined percentage of each paycheck goes
Schedule annual reviews of your giving strategy with a trusted friend
Track your giving publicly on a platform like the EA Forum or through a giving dashboard
Fourth, seek work environments that are more compatible with your values when possible. Even within finance, some firms have stronger cultures of giving back than others. Companies with strong ESG commitments or B-Corp status might have more employees who think beyond pure profit maximization.
Fifth, make your giving is tangible and emotionally rewarding. Subscribe to updates from organizations you support, arrange site visits when possible, and connect with the actual work your donations enable. This creates emotional rewards that can compete with the material rewards your colleagues pursue.
Finally, build safeguards against lifestyle inflation. Consider:
Setting a cap on your personal spending that increases more slowly than your income
Automating your savings and giving before you see the money in your checking account
Creating a ""lifestyle ratchet"" where you allow yourself modest increases in spending only after hitting certain giving milestones
Remember that some value change is natural as you gain new experiences and information. The goal isn't to rigidly adhere to your current views forever, but rather to ensure that any evolution in your giving happens through careful reflection rather than unconscious social pressure.
Would you like to discuss which of these strategies might work best for your specific situation?

“The Expanding Circle” Peter Singer,Book Excerpt,Future Good,Philosophy,"""The circle of altruism has broadened from the family and tribe to the nation and race, and we are beginning to recognize that our obligations extend to all human beings. The process should not stop there... If we have sound reasons for believing that the limit to our moral concern cannot defensibly be drawn at the boundary of our own species, that would do much to reduce the implausibility of the view that we do have obligations to assist those in absolute poverty."""," You are considering how to allocate your charitable giving budget this year and are trying to decide between three options: 1. A charity providing direct health interventions to humans in extreme poverty 2. A charity working on reducing suffering of factory-farmed animals 3. A charity researching wild animal suffering (focused on understanding and potentially reducing suffering of animals in nature) Using the Effective Altruism concept of moral circle expansion, explain how you would approach this decision. How should considerations about which beings deserve moral concern influence your giving priorities? "," Approaching your charitable giving decision through the lens of moral circle expansion requires thoughtful consideration of which beings deserve moral consideration and how to weigh their interests. Let me walk you through an Effective Altruism approach to this decision. The concept of moral circle expansion recognizes that throughout history, we have gradually extended moral consideration beyond our immediate group—from family to tribe to nation to all humans, and increasingly to non-human animals and potentially other sentient beings. This expansion isn't arbitrary but follows a principle that sentience (the capacity to experience suffering and well-being) is what grounds moral consideration. Here's how I would analyze your three options through this framework: First, examining our moral commitments: 1. Human-focused interventions All major moral frameworks agree that humans deserve moral consideration. The capacity for suffering among humans in extreme poverty is well-documented and significant. 2. Factory-farmed animals The evidence strongly suggests that many animals, particularly mammals and birds used in factory farming, are sentient and experience suffering. The conditions in factory farms often cause extreme suffering, and the scale is enormous—tens of billions of animals annually. 3. Wild animal suffering If we accept that animals deserve moral consideration based on their capacity for suffering, then logically this extends to wild animals as well. Their suffering (from disease, starvation, predation) may be vast in scale given the trillions of wild animals that exist. From an EA perspective, the key considerations would include: 1. Scale: How many individuals are affected and how severely? - Human interventions: Affects millions of people experiencing extreme poverty - Factory farming: Affects billions of animals each year in extremely confined conditions - Wild animal suffering: Potentially affects trillions of sentient beings, though with varying levels of suffering and capacity for suffering 2. Tractability: How solvable is each problem? - Human interventions: Highly tractable with proven interventions - Factory farming: Moderately tractable through corporate campaigns and alternatives - Wild animal suffering: Currently low tractability, primarily at research stage 3. Neglectedness: How many resources are already dedicated to each cause? - Human interventions: Significant resources, though still underfunded - Factory farming: Relatively neglected compared to scale - Wild animal suffering: Extremely neglected, minimal research funding 4. Moral uncertainty: How confident are we in our moral framework? - An EA approach would acknowledge uncertainty about how to weigh the interests of different beings Given these considerations, here's how you might approach your decision: If you're confident that all sentient beings deserve significant moral consideration regardless of species, you might prioritize factory farming interventions due to their combination of scale, neglectedness, and tractability. The number of animals affected and the severity of their suffering make this a potentially high-impact area. If you place substantially greater weight on human suffering or have more uncertainty about animal sentience, you might favor the human-focused interventions, which have the advantage of high tractability and strong evidence. Wild animal suffering research represents a more speculative but potentially enormous impact area. Given its current stage, it might be best viewed as a smaller allocation within a diversified giving portfolio—an ""option value"" on future interventions if research identifies tractable solutions. Many EAs address moral uncertainty through a portfolio approach—allocating funds across these different cause areas rather than choosing just one. This might mean: - 50-60% to the most promising interventions based on your current moral views - 30-40% to other cause areas you find plausible - 10% to causes that expand your moral circle further than you might currently be comfortable with, acknowledging the possibility that future generations might continue to expand the circle This approach recognizes that moral circle expansion is an ongoing process, both historically and personally, and allows your giving to reflect both your current values and the possibility that our moral understanding will continue to evolve.","{

britannica.com,Website,Distinction,Utilitarianism,"Effective altruism shares similar goals with utilitarianism, particularly when it comes to promoting good and helping others. However, there are several key differences that set the two apart. Utilitarianism centers on maximizing happiness and pleasure and minimizing unhappiness and pain. By comparison, effective altruism has a greater focus on morality and the meaning of doing good. Furthermore, effective altruism has a comparatively strong research component and advocates directly for charitable giving.","""I've been reading about effective altruism, and it sounds very similar to utilitarianism. Are they essentially the same philosophy? If not, what are the key differences between them?""","While effective altruism and utilitarianism share important commonalities, they are distinct frameworks with several key differences.
Utilitarianism is a comprehensive moral theory that holds that the right action is the one that produces the most good, typically defined as happiness, pleasure, or preference satisfaction. It makes strong claims about all moral questions, suggesting that maximizing overall welfare is always the right approach.
Effective altruism, by contrast, is better understood as a practical movement focused specifically on how to do the most good with our resources when helping others. Here are the key distinctions:
Scope and domain:
Utilitarianism aims to be a complete moral theory covering all ethical questions
Effective altruism is primarily concerned with charitable giving, career choice, and other altruistic actions, not necessarily all moral decisions
Philosophical commitments:
Utilitarianism requires accepting specific philosophical views about the nature of morality
Effective altruism is compatible with various moral frameworks (including but not limited to utilitarianism) as long as they value helping others effectively
Evidence and empiricism:
Effective altruism places stronger emphasis on empirical research and evidence-based approaches
The EA community invests heavily in cause prioritization research, randomized controlled trials, and impact evaluations
This research focus distinguishes EA from classical utilitarianism's more theoretical approach
Practical orientation:
Effective altruism is explicitly action-oriented, with concrete recommendations about donations and careers
Utilitarianism can be more abstract, without the same level of practical guidance
Moral demandingness:
Classical utilitarianism is extremely demanding, suggesting we should always maximize the good
Effective altruism often takes a more moderate approach, encouraging significant but sustainable commitment (e.g., the common 10% giving pledge)
Many effective altruists are influenced by utilitarian thinking, particularly when making quantitative comparisons between different interventions. The movement often employs utilitarian-style reasoning about expected value and impartiality.
However, you'll find effective altruists who hold various moral views, including virtue ethics, contractualism, pluralist approaches, and religious ethical frameworks. What unites them is the commitment to using evidence and reason to maximize the positive impact of their altruistic efforts, not necessarily agreement on all aspects of moral philosophy.
This practical, big-tent approach has helped effective altruism engage people with diverse philosophical backgrounds who share the common goal of doing good better.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Resource Allocation,Counterfactual,"I’m sure people have made arguments that alignment might backfire, or it could be worse than not aligning it. You can imagine ways. But still, on balance of probabilities, it seems like a reasonable bet, and not something that people are super uncertain about, or at least that I feel really uncertain about. Maybe this is the case that people focus on so much because it is among the better ones that people have ever come up with for trying to pursue differential technological development. And maybe there’s lots of other ones that were left on the scrap heap because it wasn’t clear that they were either viable or desirable. What do you think? 

Allan Dafoe: Yeah, I agree that safety and alignment are on net very beneficial bets that we should be investing heavily in. I agree with that overall assessment. To make the counter case, one would be this general equilibrium argument that the marginal return on your investment in safety and alignment is actually quite less than what you pay, because the market would otherwise have provided that.","""I recently donated to an AI safety research organization, but a friend challenged whether this was really the best use of my money. They suggested that if AI safety is valuable, big tech companies would fund it themselves out of self-interest. Is my donation actually making a difference, or would this work happen anyway without philanthropic support?""","This is an excellent question that touches on a key concept in effective altruism: counterfactual impact – or what would happen otherwise if you didn't take a particular action.
The argument that ""if AI safety were valuable, companies would fund it themselves"" reflects what economists call the efficient market hypothesis applied to charitable giving. While this reasoning has some merit, there are several compelling reasons why your donation to AI safety likely provides genuine additional value rather than simply replacing corporate funding:
First, misaligned incentives create market failures in safety research. Companies primarily optimize for competitive advantage and shareholder returns, not necessarily for long-term social benefit. Safety measures that could slow development or require industry-wide coordination face collective action problems. No company wants to unilaterally slow down if competitors don't.
Second, there's a public goods problem. The benefits of AI safety research are widely distributed (potentially to all of humanity), while the costs are concentrated on whoever funds it. Companies will rationally underinvest in public goods that they can't fully capture the value from.
Third, corporate research has different priorities. Even when companies do invest in safety, they tend to focus on near-term, product-specific safety issues rather than longer-term, more fundamental safety challenges that might not affect their bottom line for many years.
Fourth, independent research provides crucial diversity. Safety research funded outside of corporate structures can ask different questions, publish findings more openly, and challenge industry consensus when needed. This independence is vital for robust safety exploration.
That said, there are legitimate counterarguments about marginal value:
As Allan Dafoe notes in the 80,000 Hours podcast, there are ""general equilibrium"" effects where increased philanthropic funding for an area could, at the margin, reduce the incentive for corporate investment. However, the evidence suggests we're nowhere near the point where additional AI safety funding becomes ineffective – most experts in the field still consider it significantly underfunded relative to the potential risks.
When evaluating your donation's counterfactual impact, consider:
Would this specific research happen otherwise? Many safety directions remain unexplored due to funding gaps.
Is the organization you're supporting adding unique value through independence, talent, or research directions?
Does the organization effectively coordinate with other actors to avoid duplication?
If your chosen organization is doing work that corporations are unlikely to fully fund themselves, pursuing novel research directions, and effectively coordinating with the broader AI safety ecosystem, then your donation is likely providing genuine additional value rather than merely substituting for corporate funding that would have happened anyway.
Does this address your question, or would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the counterfactual impact of AI safety donations?

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Future Good,AI Safety,"AI risk concerned group thought there was a 40% chance that something from this cluster of bad outcomes would occur in the next 1,000 years, but the AI risk skeptics thought there was a 30% chance that something from this cluster of bad outcomes would occur in the next 1,000 years. So if we connect that to the forecasts we’ve been talking about throughout this conversation, about what will happen with AI risk by 2100, what we’ll see is that both groups are concerned about AI risk, but they have strong disagreements about the timing of that concern. People who are concerned in the short run remain concerned about the long run and get more concerned about the long run if you accumulate those probabilities. But the people who are skeptical about AI risk in the short run are still concerned if you look at a broader set of bad outcomes over a longer time horizon.","""I've heard widely varying estimates about the probability of AI causing human extinction - from less than one in a million to over 10%. How should effective altruists think about such low-probability but high-impact risks? And how much weight should we put on expert forecasts versus public opinion on these topics?""","The wide range of probability estimates for AI catastrophic risk highlights one of the most challenging aspects of effective altruism: how to make decisions under deep uncertainty, especially when the stakes could involve the long-term future of humanity.
You're right that estimates vary dramatically. When people are given reference comparisons for low-probability events, they often significantly revise their estimates. For instance, the median public estimate dropped from 2-5% to one in 30 million for AI-caused extinction when people were given probability benchmarks for comparison.
Here's how I suggest effective altruists approach this uncertainty:
First, recognize that expected value calculations remain useful even with uncertain probabilities. Even if we're unsure whether the probability is 0.1% or 5%, working with a range still allows us to compare expected value against other interventions. If an outcome would affect trillions of future lives, even tiny probabilities can translate to substantial expected value.
Second, pay attention to expert disagreement patterns. Both AI risk-concerned and risk-skeptical experts assign non-trivial probabilities to negative outcomes over longer timeframes. This suggests that the disagreement is often about timing and specific scenarios rather than whether advanced AI poses any substantial risks at all.
Third, consider comparative expertise carefully. On highly technical questions like AI capabilities and alignment, more weight should generally go to those with relevant technical expertise and track records of good forecasting. However, beware of echo chambers – diverse viewpoints from adjacent fields often provide valuable perspective.
Fourth, apply the ""importance, tractability, neglectedness"" (ITN) framework. Even if probabilities are uncertain, we can still assess:
Importance: The magnitude of harm from an AI catastrophe would be enormous
Neglectedness: Despite recent increases, AI safety remains relatively underfunded compared to AI capabilities research
Tractability: There are concrete research agendas that plausibly reduce risk

            ""content"": ""The wide range of probability estimates for AI catastrophic risk highlights one of the most challenging aspects of effective altruism: how to make decisions under deep uncertainty, especially when the stakes could involve the long-term future of humanity.
You're right that estimates vary dramatically. When people are given reference comparisons for low-probability events, they often significantly revise their estimates. For instance, the median public estimate dropped from 2-5% to one in 30 million for AI-caused extinction when people were given probability benchmarks for comparison.
Here's how I suggest effective altruists approach this uncertainty:
First, recognize that expected value calculations remain useful even with uncertain probabilities. Even if we're unsure whether the probability is 0.1% or 5%, working with a range still allows us to compare expected value against other interventions. If an outcome would affect trillions of future lives, even tiny probabilities can translate to substantial expected value.
Second, pay attention to expert disagreement patterns. Both AI risk-concerned and risk-skeptical experts assign non-trivial probabilities to negative outcomes over longer timeframes. This suggests that the disagreement is often about timing and specific scenarios rather than whether advanced AI poses any substantial risks at all.
Third, consider comparative expertise carefully. On highly technical questions like AI capabilities and alignment, more weight should generally go to those with relevant technical expertise and track records of good forecasting. However, beware of echo chambers – diverse viewpoints from adjacent fields often provide valuable perspective.
Fourth, apply the ""importance, tractability, neglectedness"" (ITN) framework. Even if probabilities are uncertain, we can still assess:
Importance: The magnitude of harm from an AI catastrophe would be enormous
Neglectedness: Despite recent increases, AI safety remains relatively underfunded compared to AI capabilities research
Tractability: There are concrete research agendas that plausibly reduce risk
Fifth, employ robust decision-making strategies. Rather than optimizing for a single probability estimate, look for interventions that make sense across multiple worldviews and probability ranges. Some AI safety work produces valuable knowledge even if catastrophic risks are lower than feared.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Risk Reduction,AI Safety," So we have this idea that when people say a low-probability number, they often don’t know the difference between 2% and one in 300,000 or maybe even 5% and one in a million. And giving them access to some comparison classes we thought might help to improve their forecasts. When we did that — when we gave people in the public access to a set of eight or 10 reference probabilities — the public changed their beliefs a lot. So this is the same group of people who said that 2% and 5% number I just told you about. And when we gave them these reference classes, they gave a median probability of human extinction by 2100 of one in 15 million, and a median probability of AI-caused human extinction by 2100 of one in 30 million. Let’s just compare those numbers for a second: one in 30 million is very different from 2%, right? If we’re thinking about a cost-benefit analysis or expectations, those are many orders of magnitude apart. And the same thing is true for total extinction risk. So this is maybe a place where I think we need a lot more research and understanding of how people forecast. If you’re thinking about what the superforecasters and the experts said, and you’re thinking that this 0.3% or this 3% number are correct, well, it should give you pause to know that among a survey of people who gave roughly the same number, if you give them a set of reference classes in low-probability space, they then reduce their forecasts tremendously. ","I'm trying to decide whether to donate to organizations working on AI safety versus those working on ensuring AI benefits humanity broadly (like policy work on AI access and economic impacts). If we assume AI systems don't cause extinction, should I be more worried about AI leading to dystopian outcomes or more hopeful about AI creating a flourishing future? What does the expert consensus suggest?","Your question touches on a fascinating question about the relationship between experts' views on near-term AI risk and their expectations about non-extinction AI outcomes. Interestingly, the research found that experts who are more concerned about near-term catastrophic AI risks (including extinction) are often more optimistic about positive outcomes if we avoid extinction. Conversely, those more skeptical of near-term catastrophic risks tend to expect worse outcomes for humanity in non-extinction scenarios where powerful AI is deployed.
This counterintuitive pattern suggests these groups might be thinking about AI impacts in fundamentally different ways:
The ""near-term concerned"" group may view AI development as having higher variance outcomes – either things go very wrong (extinction) or very right (flourishing). This perspective might stem from viewing AI alignment as a binary challenge: if we solve it, transformative AI could dramatically improve human welfare; if we don't, catastrophe could result.
The ""near-term skeptical"" group appears to expect more moderate outcomes in either direction, with particular concern about subtler negative consequences like economic disruption, political instability, or power concentration – even if extinction is avoided.
From an effective altruism perspective, this suggests a few considerations for your donation decision:
Explore complementarities rather than strict either/or thinking. Safety work and ""broad benefits"" work can be synergistic. Some organizations (like the Center for AI Safety or the Future of Humanity Institute) work on both technical safety and governance/policy.
Consider differential risk profiles. Safety work might reduce the probability of the worst outcomes, while policy/governance work might improve the expected quality of non-catastrophic outcomes. Both approaches have value.
Evaluate your comparative advantage. Some donors might be better positioned to support policy work (particularly those with relevant networks), while others might have better judgment about technical research.
Apply the neglectedness principle carefully. Within each category, some sub-areas receive significantly more attention than others. For instance, ""AI ethics"" broadly gets substantial corporate funding, while specific work on power concentration or economic inequality from AI might be more neglected.
Look for robust interventions. Some approaches help in both catastrophic and non-catastrophic scenarios. For example, work on AI interpretability and transparency can reduce catastrophic risks while also helping ensure AI systems are fair and beneficial in ordinary deployment.
Given the expert disagreement, a balanced portfolio approach might be wise – perhaps allocating some funding to each area, with emphasis based on your assessment of the relative neglectedness and tractability of specific organizations' work.
What's particularly valuable from an EA perspective is that you're thinking about these tradeoffs explicitly rather than assuming that preventing the worst outcomes and ensuring broad benefits are necessarily in conflict. Often, progress on one front supports progress on the other.
Would you like me to suggest specific types of organizations that work at this intersection, or would you prefer to discuss how to evaluate the marginal impact of donations in these different areas?

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Future Good,AI Safety,"If progress accelerates, will it be good for humanity or bad for humanity if it doesn’t cause human extinction? We divided up the potential outcomes for humanity due to AI by 2100 into 11 categories. And I won’t go into all the categories, but two categories where we saw a lot of disagreement were whether powerful AI would be deployed and not cause extinction, but median human wellbeing would be high; or whether powerful AI would be developed and deployed, it wouldn’t cause human extinction, and median human wellbeing would be low. What we saw is that the group of people who were concerned about short-run AI risk were much more confident that if humanity did not go extinct, then human wellbeing would actually be high. And the AI risk sceptical people thought that if powerful AI systems were developed and deployed and they didn’t cause human extinction, human wellbeing would be lower. So what that tells me is there’s this really interesting relationship between your beliefs about risk in the short run and your belief about overall variance. The concerned group thinks AI might be terrible, it might cause human extinction. If it doesn’t cause human extinction, there’s a pretty high chance that things will be great, that humans will be in really good shape, be really happy, human wellbeing will be high by 2100. And the AI risk sceptical people, maybe consistent with their concerns about risk over a longer run time horizon, think that even if AI does not cause human extinction, if powerful AI systems are developed and deployed, then it is likely that human wellbeing won’t be that high.",I'm trying to understand different perspectives on AI safety. Why do some AI safety experts seem more optimistic about non-extinction scenarios than AI skeptics? This seems counterintuitive.,"This apparent paradox in AI safety perspectives is indeed counterintuitive at first glance, but reveals something fascinating about how different experts view the relationship between risk and variance in outcomes. Let me break this down step by step.
According to research discussed on the 80,000 Hours podcast, experts were asked to categorize potential AI outcomes by 2100, and an interesting pattern emerged. The researchers found that those most concerned about short-term AI risks (the ""concerned group"") held a seemingly contradictory view: they believed AI might cause human extinction, but if humanity survived, outcomes would likely be extremely positive with high human wellbeing.
Meanwhile, AI risk skeptics—those less worried about near-term catastrophic risks—were actually more pessimistic about non-extinction scenarios, believing that even if AI doesn't cause extinction, it might still lead to lower levels of human wellbeing.
To understand this pattern, we need to think about how these groups view the distribution of possible outcomes:
The concerned group sees AI development as having extremely high variance in outcomes. In their view, the development of powerful AI systems presents a binary situation: either we solve alignment completely and create systems that genuinely advance human flourishing (leading to very positive outcomes), or we fail catastrophically (leading to extinction). There's less probability mass in the middle ground.
This perspective makes sense if you believe that the challenge of aligning AI with human values is a technical problem that will either be solved adequately or not. If we solve it, AI becomes a powerful force for good, operating exactly as we'd want. If we don't solve it, catastrophe ensues. This ""high variance"" model explains why these experts can simultaneously be most concerned about extinction while being optimistic about surviving scenarios.
The skeptical group, by contrast, envisions a more continuous distribution of outcomes. They see more possibility for partial failures of alignment—scenarios where AI doesn't cause extinction but still leads to various negative outcomes like economic disruption, surveillance, autonomy loss, or social fragmentation. Their concern isn't primarily about a single catastrophic failure but about the many ways AI might gradually erode human flourishing while falling short of causing extinction.
This difference might also reflect varying views about what exactly threatens human welfare. The concerned group may focus more on existential threats, while skeptics worry about a wider range of harms to human autonomy, dignity, and social structures that fall short of extinction.
To illustrate with an analogy: imagine two people assessing the risks of a new powerful medication. One person thinks either the medication will work perfectly or kill the patient. The other thinks the medication probably won't kill the patient but might cause a wide range of chronic side effects that reduce quality of life.
This insight helps us understand why discussing ""AI optimism"" versus ""AI pessimism"" is often unproductive—these positions aren't simply points on a single spectrum but reflect fundamentally different views about the distribution of possible outcomes and the mechanisms by which AI might affect humanity.
The difference also has important implications for risk mitigation strategies. If you believe in the high-variance model, you might focus intensely on solving technical alignment problems to avoid catastrophe and unlock huge benefits. If you hold the continuous model, you might prioritize a broader range of governance mechanisms, social policies, and incremental safety measures aimed at improving the overall trajectory of AI development.
Understanding these differing perspectives can help us have more productive conversations about AI risk by clarifying whether we're discussing the probability of extreme outcomes, the distribution of possible scenarios, or the mechanisms by which various risks might materialize.","{

Why is forecasting so important to effective altruism, and are there proven ways to make forecasts more accurate? I'm especially curious about incentive structures for better predictions.","Forecasting plays a crucial role in effective altruism because making the most positive impact often requires anticipating future developments and their consequences. Let me explain why forecasting matters so much and how we can improve its accuracy.
At its core, effective altruism aims to allocate limited resources where they'll do the most good. This inherently involves predictions about:
What problems will be most pressing in the future
Which interventions will most effectively address these problems
How various scenarios might unfold given different actions we take today
The quality of these predictions directly affects the quality of our decisions. If we misforecast the trajectory of a technology like artificial intelligence or the spread of a disease, we might prioritize the wrong interventions or miss crucial opportunities to help.
Research on improving forecasting accuracy has yielded several important findings, particularly from the work of Philip Tetlock and collaborators on using incentive structures to improve prediction accuracy.
In that study, researchers compared three groups making forecasts:
An unincentivized group
A group incentivized with a proper scoring rule (rewarded directly for accurate predictions)
A group incentivized to match what they thought superforecasters would predict
The results showed that both incentivized groups performed significantly better than the unincentivized group. This aligns with a broader pattern in effective altruism: creating systems that align incentives with our goals often leads to better outcomes.
Several principles can dramatically improve forecasting accuracy:
Aggregation: Combining multiple independent forecasts typically outperforms individual judgments. This is why prediction markets and forecasting tournaments have proven valuable.
Cognitive debiasing: Training forecasters to recognize and counteract common biases like overconfidence, anchoring, and the planning fallacy.
Explicit probabilistic reasoning: Making forecasts with specific probabilities (e.g., ""60% chance"") rather than vague terms like ""likely"" forces more precise thinking.
Regular updating: Good forecasters revise their predictions frequently as new information becomes available.
Reference class forecasting: Comparing the situation to similar historical cases rather than treating it as entirely unique.
Incentive structures: As the study demonstrated, properly aligned incentives improve accuracy.
The effective altruism community has embraced these methods through platforms like Metaculus and the Good Judgment Project, which run forecasting tournaments where participants make probabilistic predictions on questions relevant to global priorities.
For individuals seeking to contribute to effective altruism, developing good forecasting skills is valuable regardless of your specific focus area. Training yourself to think probabilistically, consider multiple scenarios, and update based on evidence helps not just with explicit predictions, but with all kinds of decision-making under uncertainty.
Organizations like Open Philanthropy often incorporate structured forecasting into their grant-making process, demonstrating how these methods can be integrated into practical decision-making to increase positive impact.
Would you like to know more about specific forecasting methods or how you might develop these skills yourself?

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Risk Reduction,AI Safety,"It seems clear that the risk does come with costs, both financial and potentially kind of incentive-y ones. Nathan Calvin: Yeah. I mean, I think it’s a question of, as I was saying before, the costs of doing these types of safety testing and compliance things I think are quite small relative to the incredibly capital-intensive nature of training these models. And again, these are things also that we’ve seen companies do. When you look at things like the GPT-4 System Card and the effort that they put into that, and similar efforts at Anthropic and other companies, these are things that are doable. There’s also something like, “Oh, I’m not going to buy insurance because there’s not a 100% chance that my house will burn down” or whatever. I think if you have a few percent risk of a really bad outcome, it is worth investing some amount of money to kind of prepare against that.","Some critics argue that focusing on AI safety measures could slow down beneficial AI progress and impose unnecessary costs on companies. If the probability of catastrophic AI risks is relatively low, are investments in AI safety still justified from an effective altruism perspective? How should we think about the cost-benefit analysis here?","From an effective altruism perspective, investments in AI safety remain justified even with relatively low probabilities of catastrophic outcomes. This position is grounded in expected value reasoning and several pragmatic considerations.
The central argument for AI safety investment comes down to the asymmetry between costs and potential benefits. Safety testing and compliance measures typically represent a small fraction of the overall expense of developing advanced AI systems. Companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and others already dedicate resources to producing system cards, red-teaming exercises, and safety evaluations – demonstrating these measures are practically implementable without prohibitive costs.
To frame this in effective altruist terms, let's consider the expected value calculation:
If we assign even a ""ew percent risk of a really bad outcome, the expected harm from inaction would be enormous. A 1-5% probability of an outcome affecting billions of people (or even the long-term future of humanity) creates a massive expected negative value that easily justifies significant preventative investments.
This logic parallels how we think about other risks in society:
Insurance analogy: Most people willingly pay for home insurance despite the low probability their house will burn down. We accept regular costs to protect against unlikely but devastating scenarios.
Precautionary infrastructure: Society invests in earthquake-resistant buildings in seismic zones, tsunami warning systems, and pandemic preparedness despite the low frequency of such events.
Regulatory safeguards: We require safety testing for pharmaceuticals, vehicle crash testing, and food safety inspections because the consequences of unsafe products outweigh the costs of verification.
Beyond the simple expected value calculation, there are additional considerations that strengthen the case for safety investments:
Reversibility asymmetry: Deploying unsafe AI systems could lead to irreversible consequences, while delaying deployment for safety testing merely postpones benefits temporarily.
Distribution of costs and benefits: The costs of safety measures fall primarily on well-resourced AI companies, while the risks of unsafe AI would be broadly distributed across society or humanity as a whole.
Co-development potential: Safety research often leads to more reliable, interpretable, and controllable AI systems – properties that have commercial value beyond preventing catastrophic risks.
Governance legitimacy: Demonstrable safety investments help maintain public and regulatory trust in AI development, potentially preventing more restrictive regulations that could more severely hamper beneficial progress.
Effective altruism emphasizes that we should evaluate interventions not just by the probability of success, but by their expected value – probability multiplied by impact. When dealing with risks that could affect billions of lives or the long-term future, even small probabilities justify significant preventative investments.
It's also worth noting that many AI safety measures can be implemented in ways that minimally impact the pace of beneficial development. The goal isn't to stop AI progress, but to ensure that progress occurs along safe and beneficial trajectories.
Would you like me to explore specific types of safety measures and their cost-effectiveness, or perhaps discuss how to prioritize among different safety approaches?

It's also worth noting that many AI safety measures can be implemented in ways that minimally impact the pace of beneficial development. The goal isn't to stop AI progress, but to ensure that progress occurs along safe and beneficial trajectories.
Would you like me to explore specific types of safety measures and their cost-effectiveness, or perhaps discuss how to prioritize among different safety approaches?

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Accurate Forecasting,Calculations,"We asked them to predict what superforecasters would say and what other experts in the domain would say. This gave us several comparison points for thinking about their beliefs: one was unincentivised, and two were incentivised to be close to a group whose forecast they couldn’t see. So they had to think about what those groups would say. In the report, we mainly focus on the unincentivised beliefs, but we do think a little bit about those incentivised beliefs. Luisa Rodriguez: OK. So that part feels a little surprising to me, but potentially important and interesting. The idea is that there’s an academic literature that says if you ask a group to make predictions about what another group will predict, those predictions are close enough to the likely true outcome that you can just reward them on their predictions about other people’s predictions, and that has the right incentive? Or am I misunderstanding? Ezra Karger: Yes, but with a very important caveat: it depends on what group you’re predicting. So if I asked you to predict what a random person who you see in New York City thinks about a topic, and you’re thinking about a very complex topic, you’re not going to be incentivised to report the truth. You’re going to be incentivised to report 50% maybe, because that’s what you expect some random person who we run into to say about a specific forecast. But we didn’t ask people to forecast what a random person would say. We asked people to forecast what a set of accurate forecasters would say, and then also what a set of experts in a domain would say.","I'm interested in improving my ability to make accurate predictions about future events, especially in areas related to technology development and global risks. What techniques do effective altruists use to improve forecasting accuracy, and how can I avoid common cognitive biases that might distort my predictions? Are there specific methods that have been empirically validated?","Improving forecasting accuracy is indeed a key skill for effective altruists, particularly when addressing uncertain futures around technology development and global risks.
Let me walk you through the most empirically-supported methods for improving prediction accuracy, starting with social calibration techniques: The research described found that asking people to predict what highly skilled forecasters (superforecasters) or domain experts would say about a question improved accuracy compared to unincentivized predictions. This approach works because it encourages people to step outside their own perspective and adopt the viewpoint of those likely to be more accurate. Importantly, this only works when predicting the views of demonstrably accurate groups, not random individuals.
Beyond this specific technique, several other empirically-validated approaches can dramatically improve forecasting accuracy:
Probabilistic thinking: Express predictions as specific probabilities (e.g., ""60% chance"") rather than vague terms like ""likely"" or ""unlikely."" This forces more precise thinking and allows for measuring accuracy over time. Start practicing by assigning probabilities to everyday predictions and tracking your calibration.
Regular updating: Good forecasters frequently revise their predictions as new information becomes available. The best forecasters make many small updates rather than occasional large shifts. Create a system to regularly revisit and update your predictions, perhaps weekly or monthly depending on the timeframe of the forecast.
Reference class forecasting: Before making a prediction about a specific case, identify similar historical cases and use their outcomes as a baseline. For example, when predicting AI development timelines, look at historical technological forecasts and their accuracy patterns. This counters the tendency to see each situation as unique.
Considering multiple scenarios: Explicitly map out several possible ways events could unfold rather than focusing on a single narrative. This helps avoid narrative fallacies where we become attached to compelling stories. Try identifying at least three distinct scenarios for any important forecast.
Decomposing complex questions: Break down complex forecasting questions into simpler components that are easier to estimate. For example, rather than directly predicting ""Will AGI be developed by 2030?"", decompose this into questions about compute growth, algorithmic improvements, and investment trends.
Aggregating diverse viewpoints: As highlighted in the Tetlock and Mellers research, combining multiple independent forecasts typically outperforms even expert individual judgment. Seek out diverse perspectives when making important predictions, giving extra weight to those with strong track records.
Keeping a forecasting journal: Document not just your predictions but your reasoning process. This creates accountability and helps identify patterns in your thinking. Review this periodically to identify which types of forecasts you're better or worse at.
Explicit debiasing techniques: Actively counteract known biases:
Combat overconfidence by intentionally widening your confidence intervals
Reduce availability bias by seeking out non-salient examples
Counter status quo bias by imagining you're forecasting from a future perspective
Mitigate anchoring by considering extreme scenarios first before moderate ones
Training with immediate feedback: Platforms like Metaculus, Good Judgment Open, and CSET Foretell allow you to make predictions on real-world questions and receive scoring feedback. Regular practice with feedback is perhaps the most reliable way to improve forecasting skills.
These approaches have been validated through the Good Judgment Project, which identified techniques that enabled ordinary people to make predictions that outperformed intelligence analysts with access to classified information.
For technology development and global risks specifically, effective altruists often supplement these general techniques with deep domain knowledge and cross-disciplinary awareness, recognizing that major developments often emerge from the intersection of multiple fields.
Would you like me to elaborate on any particular technique, or discuss how to apply these specifically to technology forecasting?

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Responsible Scaling Policy ,AI Safety,"""It aligns commercial incentives with safety goals. Once we put this RSP [Responsible Scaling Policy] in place, it's now the case that our safety teams are under the same pressure as our product teams — where if we want to ship a model, and we get to ASL-3, the thing that will block us from being able to get revenue, being able to get users, et cetera, is: Do we have the ability to deploy it safely? It's a nice outcome-based approach... It's: Did we succeed?""","A policymaker has approached your effective altruism research organization for guidance. They're concerned about the rapid advancement of AI capabilities and the potential risks this poses. They ask: ""From an effective altruism perspective, what principles should guide responsible scaling policies for advanced AI systems? How should we balance innovation benefits against potential catastrophic risks?""","From an effective altruism perspective, responsible scaling policy for AI should be guided by a careful weighing of enormous potential benefits against unprecedented risks, with particular attention to extreme outcomes that could affect the long-term future of humanity. Let me outline some key principles that follow from EA reasoning:

First, the stakes are extraordinarily high. Advanced AI systems could eventually generate trillions of dollars in economic value, help solve our most pressing scientific challenges, and dramatically improve human welfare. Yet the same systems could potentially pose existential risks through misalignment with human values, strategic destabilization, or malicious use. When applying EA thinking, we must acknowledge that these are not typical policy tradeoffs – they involve potentially irreversible consequences affecting countless future generations.

Core principles for responsible scaling should include:

1. **Differential technological development**: Prioritize safety research over capabilities advancement when uncertainty about risks is high. This might mean instituting a ""pause"" or slowdown in certain types of capability scaling until safety measures catch up. This applies the EA principle of expected value calculation under uncertainty.

2. **Existential risk reduction**: Given the potential impact on all future generations, even a small probability of catastrophic failure justifies substantial investment in safety. A key EA insight is that averting existential risk has enormous expected value because it preserves humanity's entire future potential.

3. **Global coordination mechanisms**: Since AI development is competitive and distributed, unilateral restraint may simply cede influence to less cautious actors. EA thinking suggests we need robust international governance frameworks that prevent racing dynamics while preserving beneficial innovation.

4. **Robust monitoring and verification**: Deploy technical and institutional measures to verify compliance with safety standards, with gradual deployment of increasingly capable systems conditional on demonstrated safety.

5. **Equitable distribution of benefits**: Ensure AI's benefits are widely shared rather than concentrated, which can help align incentives globally around responsible development.

When balancing innovation benefits against catastrophic risks, EA suggests:

- Apply expected value calculations that properly weight low-probability but extreme outcomes
- Recognize moral uncertainty by being cautious about irreversible decisions
- Ensure that decision-making power involves diverse stakeholders, including representatives concerned with long-term impacts
- Implement regular reviews of policy as our understanding of AI capabilities and risks evolves

Concrete policy recommendations might include establishing independent safety assessment institutions, requiring substantial safety research investments proportional to compute used for training frontier models, creating liability frameworks for AI deployment harms, and developing technical measures for demonstrating safety properties before scaling to more capable systems.

The effective altruism perspective uniquely emphasizes that decisions about AI scaling today may be among the most consequential choices humanity ever makes, affecting countless future generations. This time-agnostic moral view suggests erring on the side of caution when risks could be existential, while still pursuing beneficial applications where risks are better understood and manageable.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Risk Reduction,AI Safety,"""Let's maybe start with what I think is a very obvious one, which is reducing and hardening authorised access... centralising and managing all copies of the weights in a proper access-controlled system. You should not have copies of the weights lying around in people's laptops... You need your system to allow for permissioning... monitoring... and it needs to prevent just trivially copying it.","I work at an AI company that's developing increasingly capable models. From an effective altruism perspective, what security measures should we prioritize to prevent misuse of our technology? Our resources are limited, so we need to focus on the most important safeguards first.","From an effective altruism perspective, prioritizing security measures for advanced AI systems requires focusing on interventions that address the most serious risks first, especially those that could have wide-scale negative impacts if exploited. Let’s start with properly securing the model weights themselves.
Here's a prioritized approach based on EA principles of focusing on importance, tractability, and neglectedness:
First tier priorities (addressing catastrophic risks with relatively straightforward solutions):
Weights security and access control: This is fundamental. Implement a centralized, robustly access-controlled system for all model weights. This includes:
Preventing unauthorized copying of weights to personal devices
Implementing proper permissioning systems with least-privilege access
Maintaining comprehensive access logs and monitoring
Securing against both external and internal threats
This addresses the risk of model theft which could lead to uncontrolled proliferation of your capabilities, potentially bypassing any safety measures you've implemented.
Red-teaming and adversarial testing: Systematically probe your models for vulnerabilities before deployment, focusing on:
Jailbreaking attempts to bypass safety guardrails
Testing for harmful capabilities (e.g., generating dangerous instructions)
Identifying exploitable biases or behaviors
This tackles the risk of capabilities you haven't anticipated being discovered and exploited by malicious actors after release.
Deployment controls and monitoring: Implement systems to:
Monitor model usage patterns for suspicious activities
Create circuit breakers that can quickly limit or shut down systems if misuse is detected
Deploy models initially in limited contexts before wider release
Second tier priorities (addressing serious but less catastrophic risks):
Secure API infrastructure: Ensure that access to your models via APIs is properly secured with:
Strong authentication requirements
Rate limiting to prevent abuse
Input filtration to block known harmful prompts
Output scanning for dangerous content
Supply chain security: Verify the integrity of:
Training data (to prevent poisoning attacks)
Software dependencies
Hardware components used in your infrastructure
Security culture and insider threat mitigation: Develop:
Security training for all staff
Clear policies around responsible disclosure
Whistleblower protections
Background checks for those with elevated access
The effective altruist framework suggests focusing particularly on preventing low-probability but high-consequence events. With advanced AI systems, theft or misuse could potentially lead to large-scale harm through:
Proliferation of dangerous capabilities to malicious actors
Deployment of models without necessary safety measures
Use in large-scale cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, or other harmful applications
When prioritizing with limited resources, consider implementing simplified versions of the higher-tier controls before moving to lower-tier ones. For example, a basic but comprehensive access control system for weights is better than a sophisticated API security system if the weights themselves remain vulnerable.
Also consider the neglectedness principle: your company may already have standard cybersecurity practices in place (password policies, network security), but the AI-specific controls like weight security and red-teaming might be less established and therefore more neglected despite their importance.
Remember that security is a process, not a product. Start with these fundamentals, but plan to continuously reassess and strengthen your security posture as your models become more capable and as new threats emerge.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific security measure or discuss how to implement these priorities in resource-constrained environments?

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Future Good,AI Safety,"China’s potential export of these systems that we talked about before that could be used as mass surveillance and enforcing authoritarian rule to other countries, and thereby spreading its ideology — and I think causing a huge amount of disvalue… I think a big one that I’ve been thinking about increasingly is: how do global deliberative processes look when we eventually have to make the call to go ahead with the intelligence explosion? And let me just paint the picture of this. 

Let’s say it’s the year 2040, and we have some sense that AI systems are approaching a threshold where it is generally capable, similar to human capabilities in almost all domains. And therefore, it’s able to start speeding up science and technology innovation, it’s able to start doing AI research, and we can actually deploy it at a vast scale because of the compute overhang that we have from training. Now, how do we make the choice to do this or not? Because it’s quite likely that once we make this decision, things are going to go really, really fast. Now, we may want to make sure that if China is in the position to do this, they are not going to push the button without talking to the rest of the world to make sure that this goes well. We also want to make sure that if America were to do this, China is not in a position to nuke us first, because a decision maker in China may look at the situation and think, “This is going to forever make America dominant in human history, and we may want to take the chances to annihilate them.”… And beyond the risks of just kinetic conflict, I think in a situation where you are staring down the intelligence explosion, you really want to make sure that there are good deliberative processes that bring in voices from all of humanity and are going to feel the consequences of whatever you’re going to do next. You want to make sure that there’s a way to bring all the countries to the table. And if I were the US, I want China to be at the table, I want India to be at the table, I want Mozambique to be at the table. And I want to make sure that they’re able to meaningfully make decisions about what the future of humanity looks like — meaning that there is the deliberative infrastructure, there is the education needed for them to actually understand what is about to happen. And we should do this collectively, in terms of understanding where AI is at and what all the potential implications are from people’s perspectives","I'm considering donating to organizations working on international AI governance and cooperation. From an effective altruism perspective, why might global coordination on AI development be important, and what are the most neglected but important aspects of this work? I'm particularly interested in understanding how this relates to long-term global catastrophic risks.","From an effective altruism perspective, global coordination on AI development represents one of the most important and potentially neglected interventions for safeguarding humanity's long-term future. International coordination on AI governance addresses several distinct risks that could lead to catastrophic outcomes:
Competitive dynamics and safety trade-offs: Without coordination, organizations and nations may feel pressured to race ahead with AI development while cutting corners on safety research. This classic prisoner's dilemma could lead rational actors to collectively create outcomes none of them want. Coordination mechanisms can help align incentives toward safer development pathways.
Authoritarian applications: There’s a serious risk of advanced AI systems being exported to strengthen authoritarian regimes through enhanced surveillance and social control. This could lead to tremendous suffering and potentially irreversible shifts in power structures globally. International governance frameworks could establish norms and restrictions on the most harmful applications.
Crisis decision-making: Perhaps most critically, in the ""intelligence explosion"" scenario, humanity faces decisions about deploying systems capable of recursive self-improvement. Without established forums and protocols for global deliberation, such a scenario could trigger dangerous unilateral actions or even preemptive military conflicts between major powers.
When evaluating where to direct your support, consider these particularly neglected but important aspects of global AI governance:
1. Inclusive deliberative infrastructure: We need mechanisms to ensure all nations—not just major AI powers—have meaningful input into decisions that could affect all of humanity. Organizations working to build legitimate, technically-informed international forums that include perspectives from the Global South may be particularly neglected yet vital.
2. Technical verification systems: For meaningful agreements to work, nations need ways to verify compliance. Organizations developing technical standards and monitoring capabilities that could verify adherence to AI safety agreements are working on a critical but often overlooked component of governance.
3. Crisis protocols: Work on establishing specific procedures for managing the deployment of increasingly capable AI systems, particularly around potential intelligence explosion scenarios, remains severely underdeveloped relative to its importance.
4. Strategic stability between major powers: Organizations addressing how AI advances might destabilize nuclear deterrence or create new security dilemmas between the US, China, and other powers are tackling a critical path to reducing catastrophic risks.
5. Public education and engagement: Public understanding of advanced AI risks and governance options remains limited, creating vulnerability to simplistic narratives during crises. Support for sophisticated public communication about these issues could help create political space for necessary governance measures.
From a long-termist effective altruist perspective, the case for prioritizing global AI governance is compelling because:
These interventions address both near-term and long-term risks
The window for establishing effective governance may close as capabilities advance
Unlike some technical safety challenges, many governance approaches have clear historical precedents (e.g., nuclear non-proliferation frameworks)
The field remains relatively neglected compared to technical AI research
When evaluating specific organizations, look for those that:
Have credible pathways to influence key decision-makers
Demonstrate technical sophistication and nuanced understanding of both AI capabilities and international relations
Take seriously both the potential benefits and risks of advanced AI
Are building authentic multinational collaboration rather than simply promoting Western perspectives
This area exemplifies effective altruism's focus on addressing neglected problems of tremendous scale with tractable approaches, particularly when considering humanity's long-term future.

How should an effective altruist think about the potential value of meta-science compared to direct interventions with more measurable outcomes?,"This is an excellent question that gets at a fundamental consideration in effective altruism: comparing interventions with different levels of certainty but potentially vastly different scales of impact.
The meta-science approach represents what we might call a ""high-leverage"" intervention – one where a relatively small input could create outsized effects through systemic improvement. Let's analyze this through an effective altruist framework.
if we spend approximately $360 billion annually on scientific research globally, making that money just 10% more efficient would effectively create $36 billion in additional scientific productivity. If we accept the estimate that each dollar spent on science generates about $70 in social value (a figure supported by some economic research), this could translate to an astounding $2.5 trillion in additional social value per year.
To evaluate this claim from an effective altruist perspective, we should consider several factors:
First, let's examine the evidence base. Direct global health interventions often have robust evidence from randomized controlled trials showing their effects. For instance, we know with high confidence that antimalarial bed nets save lives at approximately $3,000-$5,000 per life saved. Meta-science initiatives typically have a less direct evidence chain – we need evidence that their interventions actually improve scientific productivity, and then evidence for how improved scientific productivity translates to human wellbeing.
Second, consider time horizons. Global health interventions typically produce benefits within months or years. Meta-science might take longer to show results but could continue generating value for decades as improved scientific practices become standard. This relates to the effective altruist principle of considering long-term impacts.
Third, think about neglectedness. Global health receives significant attention from major funders, though many effective interventions remain underfunded. Meta-science is a relatively newer and more neglected area, potentially offering more ""low-hanging fruit"" for impact.
Fourth, explore the causal mechanisms. How precisely would the meta-science organization improve scientific productivity? Do they have a plausible theory of change and preliminary evidence supporting their approach? The most promising meta-science initiatives target specific, well-documented inefficiencies in how research is funded, conducted, or disseminated.
A thoughtful effective altruist approach might consider:
Portfolio diversification: Allocating some funding to more established interventions and some to higher-risk, higher-reward approaches like meta-science.
Sequential decision-making: Starting with a smaller donation to the meta-science organization to test their approach and ability to demonstrate progress on intermediate outcomes.
Value of information: Explicitly valuing the knowledge gained from supporting novel approaches, which can inform future allocation decisions.
The calculation represents the upper bound of potential impact if everything goes as planned. A more conservative estimate would account for uncertainty about:
Whether the meta-science interventions will achieve the full 10% productivity boost
Whether scientific discoveries consistently translate to social value at the $70 per dollar rate
How long it would take for these benefits to materialize
Even with significant uncertainty discounts, meta-science initiatives could plausibly offer comparable or greater expected value than direct interventions if their approach targets well-documented inefficiencies in the scientific process.
Would you like to discuss specific meta-science approaches that seem particularly promising from an effective altruist perspective, or would you prefer to explore how to build a balanced giving portfolio that includes both direct and systemic interventions?

That might include looping in external experts to help us with it, but we should put in the best effort that we can to mitigate these issues, such that we can still realise the benefits and deploy the technology, but without the dangers.""","My team has developed an AI system that shows exceptional capabilities, but we've also discovered some concerning safety issues. From an effective altruism perspective, should we continue development while working on safety in parallel, or should we pause development entirely to focus on addressing the safety concerns first? What framework should guide this decision?","From an effective altruism perspective, your situation presents a classic case where careful weighing of potential benefits against risks is essential. When significant safety concerns arise, the appropriate response is to pause further capability development and redirect those resources toward addressing safety issues.
This approach aligns with several core effective altruist principles:
Expected value reasoning: While the AI system's capabilities may offer substantial benefits, the expected value calculation must account for both the probability and magnitude of potential harms. Even a small probability of severe harm (especially at scale) can outweigh large expected benefits in this calculation. Pausing development doesn't mean abandoning the potential benefits permanently—it means ensuring those benefits can be realized safely.
Asymmetric downside risks: Some risks have effectively unlimited downside. If your AI system could potentially cause significant, widespread, or irreversible harm, the asymmetry between potential benefits and worst-case scenarios justifies extraordinary caution. The precautionary principle carries more weight when dealing with technologies that could scale rapidly or be difficult to control once deployed.
Option value preservation: By pausing capability advancement to focus on safety, you preserve the option to continue development later, after addressing the concerns. Conversely, rushing ahead might create unintended consequences that permanently foreclose better future options.
Here's a practical framework for making this decision:
Assess the nature and severity of the safety issues:
Are they well-defined or ambiguous?
Could they cause harm at scale or to vulnerable populations?
Are they inherent to the approach or separable from the core functionality?
How difficult are they likely to be to resolve?
Evaluate your team's safety capacity:
Do you have the expertise to address these issues internally?
Would looping in external experts significantly improve your ability to address them?
Can safety work proceed effectively while resources are still diverted to capability advancement?
Consider the competitive landscape:
Would pausing create space for less responsible actors to advance similar technology?
Could you mitigate this by sharing safety concerns (appropriately) with the broader research community?
Are there opportunities for coordinated advancement with safety as a priority?
Implement a staged approach:
Full pause: Stop all capability advancement work and redirect those resources to safety
Modified pause: Continue theoretical research but pause implementation or scaling
Partial pause: Slow capability work while significantly increasing safety resources
Parallel track: Maintain current allocation but establish clear safety thresholds that would trigger a pause
An effective altruist might recommend the first option—a full pause with concentrated focus on safety—which is likely the most prudent approach when significant concerns have been identified.
From an effective altruist standpoint, remember that what ultimately matters is the net impact on the world. Rushing to deploy a system with known safety issues risks not only direct harm but also potential backlash that could impede beneficial AI development broadly. Demonstrating that your team takes safety seriously enough to pause when necessary builds trust and helps establish norms that other developers may follow.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Evidence Based Forecasting,Ai Safety,"""If you imagine every AI growing exponentially, then whatever the existing different ratios of power are all get preserved. But if you imagine it growing super exponentially, then what happens is that if you're a little bit ahead, then the ratio of the lead actually starts increasing.""","I've heard discussions about AI progress potentially being 'super-exponential' rather than merely exponential, and how this affects competitive dynamics between leading AI labs. From an effective altruism perspective, how should we think about different growth scenarios in AI capabilities, and what implications might these have for safety concerns and coordination between organizations developing advanced AI?","From an effective altruism perspective, understanding potential AI progress trajectories is crucial for addressing existential risks and ensuring beneficial outcomes. The distinction between exponential and super-exponential growth patterns has profound implications for safety concerns, coordination challenges, and strategic priorities.
Let's unpack this concept and its implications:
Understanding Growth Patterns
In exponential growth, the rate of progress increases by a constant factor over equal time periods (e.g., doubling every year). Under this model, if Lab A is ahead of Lab B by a certain amount, they'll maintain roughly that same relative advantage over time.
In super-exponential growth, however, the growth rate itself accelerates over time. If you're a little bit ahead, then the ratio of the lead actually starts increasing. This means small initial advantages can rapidly compound into insurmountable leads.
Super-exponential growth might occur through several mechanisms:
AI systems helping to improve themselves or develop their successors
Increasing returns to scale in AI research
Complementary advances across multiple domains enhancing each other
Threshold effects where certain capabilities unlock many others
Implications for AI Safety and Governance
This growth pattern distinction has several critical implications for effective altruist priorities:
1. Racing dynamics and safety trade-offs: Super-exponential growth could intensify competitive pressures between organizations. If being slightly behind today means being far behind tomorrow, organizations face stronger incentives to prioritize speed over safety. This creates precisely the conditions where corners might be cut on crucial safety work.
2. Coordination windows: If progress follows super-exponential patterns, the window for establishing effective coordination mechanisms between leading organizations may be shorter than commonly assumed. Governance frameworks and safety standards need to be developed proactively, before competitive dynamics become overwhelming.
3. Concentration of power: Super-exponential returns could lead to extreme concentration of AI capabilities in one or very few organizations. From an effective altruist perspective, this raises profound questions about power distribution and decision-making about technologies that could affect all of humanity.
4. Strategic stability concerns: Nations might perceive super-exponential AI advancement as creating ""winner-takes-all"" dynamics in geopolitical power, potentially destabilizing international relations and increasing conflict risks. This could undermine the safety-focused cooperation needed to address global risks.
Effective Altruist Approaches
Given these considerations, effective altruists might prioritize:
1. Research to clarify growth trajectories: Supporting work that improves our understanding of likely AI development patterns and identifies early indicators of super-exponential trends.
2. Advance governance mechanisms: Developing and implementing governance frameworks, safety standards, and coordination mechanisms before competitive pressures potentially become overwhelming.
3. Promote cooperative norms: Working to establish norms and incentives that reward responsible development practices and information sharing about safety challenges.
4. Support broad distribution of safety knowledge: Ensuring that safety techniques and best practices are widely available, not concentrated in just the leading labs, to prevent safety expertise from becoming a competitive bottleneck.
5. Explore commitment mechanisms: Developing ways for organizations to credibly commit to safety-focused development paths, even as competitive pressures intensify.
The difference between exponential and super-exponential growth might seem like a technical distinction, but it fundamentally changes the strategic landscape for ensuring AI development proceeds safely. If super-exponential dynamics are plausible, they strengthen the case for early, proactive intervention on governance and safety coordination rather than reactive approaches.
Would you like to explore any particular aspect of these growth dynamics further, such as potential commitment mechanisms or how we might detect early signals of super-exponential progress?

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Global Poverty,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,"And when I say “ourselves,” I’m speaking of people from this kind of privileged background: not so much as to where you fall in the income spectrum in your own country, but particularly people from, say, the UK or Australia or the US, where even the median person, the middle person in the income distribution in those countries, are among the top percent or two in the world income distribution . I was thinking deeply about these things and then I actually was introduced to Jason Matheny , who had been an architecture student, who had found a book called Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries , DCP, in his library at university, and it changed his life. And he dropped out of his course and actually went on to help write the second edition of that book. And that book was all about how cost effective it can be to help people in poor countries — so actually trying to do the science on this and work out, really, how much does it cost to save a life? Or as they more commonly did it, in something like a quality-adjusted life year : so it’s important that we extend people’s lives by a larger amount, not just that they die the next month or something, and also that that extension is in as high a quality of health as possible. And also that there are things that don’t involve saving a life, such as curing blindness, which take the years in someone’s life and make them better.","I'm new to effective altruism and keep hearing the term 'quality-adjusted life year' or QALY. Could you explain what this metric is, why it's important in effective altruism, and how it helps us compare different interventions? I'm especially interested in understanding how it relates to global poverty interventions.","Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) are a fundamental metric in effective altruism that helps us make more precise comparisons between different health interventions and their impacts. Let me explain what they are, why they matter, and how they connect specifically to global poverty work.
At its core, a QALY combines two crucial dimensions of health outcomes: the length of life and the quality of that life. One QALY represents one year lived in perfect health. Years lived with health limitations are assigned partial values based on the severity of those limitations.
The concept emerged from the recognition that health interventions can help people in two distinct ways:
First, interventions can extend life – preventing someone from dying early from a disease like malaria or tuberculosis. This addresses the quantity of life.
Second, interventions can improve quality of life – such as curing blindness or relieving chronic pain. Someone might live the same number of years, but with significantly improved wellbeing.
QALYs provide a unified way to measure both types of benefits, allowing for more meaningful comparisons across very different interventions.
Why QALYs Matter in Effective Altruism
Effective altruism is fundamentally concerned with doing the most good possible with our limited resources. This requires comparing different interventions that might:
Save lives but leave people with disabilities
Not save lives but dramatically improve quality of life
Provide small benefits to many people
Provide large benefits to fewer people
Without a common metric like QALYs, these comparisons become much more difficult and potentially arbitrary. QALYs help make these trade-offs more explicit and evidence-based.
For example, without QALYs, how would we compare:
A program that prevents 100 deaths from malaria
A program that cures blindness for 500 people
A program that treats chronic pain for 1,000 people
QALYs give us a framework to evaluate these diverse outcomes on a common scale.
QALYs and Global Poverty
The connection between QALYs and global poverty is particularly important. There are dramatic disparities in global income distribution, with even middle-income individuals in countries like the US, UK, or Australia being among the top 1-2% globally. This extreme inequality means there are often opportunities to produce QALYs far more cost-effectively in lower-income settings.
The book ""Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries"" was transformative precisely because it quantified just how cost-effective health interventions in lower-income countries can be. This work helped establish that:
The cost to save a life or improve health varies enormously between different countries and interventions
Some of the most cost-effective health interventions remain significantly underfunded
We can achieve dramatic improvements in global health by directing resources toward these high-impact opportunities
A concrete example: Providing a child with a bed net to prevent malaria might cost around $7 (through effective charities like the Against Malaria Foundation) and produce multiple QALYs by preventing death or disability. The same amount spent on healthcare in high-income countries might produce only a tiny fraction of a QALY.
Practical Applications and Limitations
In practice, QALYs are calculated using surveys that ask people to evaluate how they would value living with various health conditions. While not perfect, these assessments provide a systematic way to incorporate quality of life into health measurements.
Some important limitations to be aware of:
QALYs don't capture all aspects of wellbeing (such as social connection or autonomy)
QALY valuations might vary across cultures and contexts
QALYs focus on health outcomes and don't directly measure other dimensions of poverty
Despite these limitations, QALYs have become an essential tool in the effective altruist toolkit, helping guide resource allocation toward interventions that create the greatest improvement in human welfare per dollar spent.
Organizations like GiveWell use metrics similar to QALYs in their charity evaluations, though they sometimes employ variations like disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) or their own ""moral weights"" frameworks that account for additional factors.
Would you like to explore more about how QALYs are practically calculated, or perhaps discuss how they compare to other metrics used in evaluating charitable interventions?

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Global Poverty,Framework,"There’s no doubt that rates of extreme poverty have fallen dramatically. COVID was a significant setback for sure, but setting COVID aside, the global poverty gap — the amount by which people living in poverty are below the line — has shrunk dramatically over the years. So I think it’s better to frame the question for us as, “What can we do to accelerate that?” — as opposed to, “What can we do to lift people up out of extreme poverty?” — because the latter sort of leads to this mindset of they’re just going to stay stuck there forever unless we figure out the solution. And that’s just clearly counterfactual. That’s just not the case. So having said that, what do we mean by “general equilibrium”? What economists mean by general equilibrium is that one person’s actions have broader ripple effects and ramifications on other people through the economy, because we live in this interconnected system.","I've heard conflicting information about global poverty trends. Some say we're making great progress, while others suggest things aren't improving much. From an effective altruism perspective, what's the current understanding of global poverty trends, and how should this inform where we direct our charitable giving? Also, what does the term 'general equilibrium' mean in this context?","From an effective altruism perspective, understanding global poverty trends is essential for directing resources where they can do the most good.
Global Poverty Trends: Significant Progress with Recent Challenges
The evidence overwhelmingly shows that extreme poverty has declined dramatically over recent decades. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed one of history's most remarkable reductions in extreme poverty:
In 1990, approximately 36% of the global population lived in extreme poverty (then defined as living on less than $1.90 per day)
By 2019, this had fallen to about 8.4% despite significant population growth
This represents over 1 billion people moving out of extreme poverty—an unprecedented achievement in human history. The ""global poverty gap"" (the amount by which people fall below the poverty line) has shrunk substantially over this period.
However, this progress has faced significant setbacks:
The COVID-19 pandemic pushed an estimated 97 million additional people into extreme poverty in 2020. Recent conflicts, including the war in Ukraine, have created additional economic pressures. Climate change impacts are increasingly affecting vulnerable populations. Despite these setbacks, the long-term trend remains one of substantial progress. This has important implications for how effective altruists approach global poverty.
Framing Our Role: Acceleration Rather Than Sole Responsibility
It’s more accurate to frame our role as ""accelerating"" poverty reduction rather than single-handedly ""lifting people out of poverty."" This distinction is important for several reasons:
It acknowledges the agency and efforts of people in low-income countries themselves
It recognizes the complex economic, political, and social factors driving poverty reduction
It helps us focus on interventions that complement and enhance existing progress
It avoids the misconception that people would ""stay stuck forever unless we figure out the solution""
This framing guides us toward interventions that remove specific barriers to progress or provide targeted support that accelerates existing positive trends.
Understanding ""General Equilibrium"" Effects
The term ""general equilibrium"" refers to the broader ripple effects and systemic impacts of interventions beyond their direct effects. In economics, it recognizes that actions don't occur in isolation but interact with complex systems.
For global poverty interventions, considering general equilibrium effects means asking questions like:
How might providing cash transfers to one group affect local prices, wages, or business activity?
Could training programs in one sector affect labor markets more broadly?
How might successful interventions in one community influence neighboring areas?
What are the long-term, system-wide effects beyond the immediate beneficiaries?
These considerations are crucial because interventions that look highly effective when considering only direct impacts might have different overall effects when accounting for these broader dynamics.
Implications for Effective Altruist Giving
This understanding suggests several approaches for effective altruists concerned with global poverty:
Support scalable interventions with proven track records: Organizations like GiveDirectly (cash transfers), Against Malaria Foundation, or Evidence Action (deworming, clean water) have demonstrated their ability to accelerate poverty reduction.
Look for specific barriers with targeted solutions: Interventions addressing specific obstacles to progress—whether health-related (vaccines, preventable diseases), financial (access to banking), or educational—can be particularly effective at accelerating existing trends.
Consider systemic approaches alongside direct aid: Supporting policy reform, institutional improvements, or research that addresses underlying structural issues can have high leverage in the long term.
Value rigorous evaluation that considers broader effects: Prioritize organizations that measure not just immediate outcomes but attempt to understand broader impacts, including potential unintended consequences.
Maintain a balanced time horizon: While supporting immediate needs, also consider interventions that may take longer to show results but could have more substantial impacts on poverty reduction trajectories.
The evidence suggests that well-targeted philanthropy can meaningfully accelerate global poverty reduction, even as broader economic forces continue to drive progress. By understanding both the encouraging long-term trends and the specific barriers that remain, effective altruists can direct resources toward interventions with the greatest potential to build on and accelerate existing progress.

Global Poverty Trends: Significant Progress with Recent Challenges
The evidence overwhelmingly shows that extreme poverty has declined dramatically over recent decades. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed one of history's most remarkable reductions in extreme poverty:
In 1990, approximately 36% of the global population lived in extreme poverty (then defined as living on less than $1.90 per day)
By 2019, this had fallen to about 8.4% despite significant population growth
This represents over 1 billion people moving out of extreme poverty—an unprecedented achievement in human history. The ""global poverty gap"" (the amount by which people fall below the poverty line) has shrunk substantially over this period.
However, this progress has faced significant setbacks:
The COVID-19 pandemic pushed an estimated 97 million additional people into extreme poverty in 2020. Recent conflicts, including the war in Ukraine, have created additional economic pressures. Climate change impacts are increasingly affecting vulnerable populations. Despite these setbacks, the long-term trend remains one of substantial progress.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Neglectdness  ,AI Safety,"Other things about security is that I think it’s very, very hard, just very hard to make these systems hard to steal for a state actor, and so there’s just a tonne of room to go and make things better. There could be security research on innovative new methods, and there can also be a lot of blocking and tackling — just getting companies to do things that we already know need to be done, but that are really hard to do in practice, take a lot of work, take a lot of iteration. Also, a nice thing about security, as opposed to some of these other things: it is a relatively mature field, so you can learn about security in some other context and then apply it to AI. Part of me kind of thinks that the EA community or whatever kind of screwed up by not emphasising security more. It’s not too hard for me to imagine a world where we’ve just been screaming about the AI security problem for the last 10 years, and how do you stop a very powerful system from getting stolen? That problem is extremely hard. We’ve made a bunch of progress on it. There were tonnes of people concerned about this stuff on the security teams of all the top AI companies, and were not as active and only had a few people working on alignment.","I've been involved in the effective altruism community for a few years and have mostly focused on global health interventions. Recently, I've been hearing more about AI security as a neglected area within AI safety work. What is AI security, how does it differ from AI alignment, and why might it be a high-impact area to work on from an effective altruism perspective?","AI security represents a critical but historically underemphasized component of the broader AI safety landscape. While it's received less attention than alignment work within effective altruism circles, there are compelling reasons to consider it a high-impact area worthy of significant focus.
To understand AI security, it helps to distinguish it from alignment. AI alignment focuses on ensuring that AI systems pursue goals aligned with human values and intentions—essentially, that AI systems want to do what humans want them to do. Security, on the other hand, focuses on protecting AI systems and their components (like model weights, training data, and infrastructure) from unauthorized access, theft, misuse, or manipulation.

First, there's the difficulty challenge. Securing advanced AI systems against state-level actors or sophisticated adversaries presents an extraordinarily hard problem, even with our best current security practices. This is especially concerning as models become more powerful and potentially dangerous if misused. The fundamental challenge isn't just theoretical—it involves implementing robust security measures in real-world contexts where even small vulnerabilities could lead to catastrophic outcomes.
Second, AI security benefits from being a relatively mature field with established expertise. Unlike some other areas of AI safety that require pioneering entirely new approaches, security builds on decades of work in cybersecurity, cryptography, and information security. This means individuals can develop expertise in traditional security domains and then apply that knowledge specifically to AI systems. This transferability creates more accessible pathways for talent to contribute meaningfully.
Third, the neglectedness factor is significant. The effective altruism community may have ""screwed up by not emphasizing security more."" Despite being a crucial component of safe AI development, security has received disproportionately less attention compared to alignment research. This neglectedness creates an opportunity for substantial marginal impact—investing resources in an area that others have overlooked despite its importance.
From an effective altruism perspective, working on AI security is compelling for several reasons:
Tractability: Unlike some theoretical alignment problems, many security challenges have concrete, implementable solutions. There's a clear path to impact through both ""innovative new methods"" and ""blocking and tackling""—implementing known best practices across the industry.
Scale: The potential consequences of security failures grow proportionally with AI capabilities. A security breach involving highly advanced AI systems could lead to proliferation of dangerous capabilities, potential misuse, or loss of control—affecting large populations or even future generations.
Neglectedness: Despite its importance, AI security remains understaffed relative to both alignment research and commercial AI development. This creates opportunities for high marginal impact.
Complementarity: Security work complements other AI safety efforts. Even perfectly aligned AI systems would pose risks if vulnerable to theft or manipulation. Conversely, robust security buys time for alignment research to mature.
Practical contributions to AI security might include:
Developing specialized security protocols for AI development environments
Creating methods to verify the provenance and integrity of models
Building systems to detect unauthorized access or use of powerful models
Researching techniques to make model theft more difficult
Working with AI labs to implement security best practices
Advocating for regulatory frameworks that incentivize strong security measures
As AI systems become more powerful, security becomes increasingly critical. The field needs people with technical security expertise, but also those who can think about governance, incentives, and implementation challenges. Given the combination of importance, tractability, and neglectedness, AI security represents a promising area for effective altruists seeking to contribute to safe and beneficial AI development.
Would you be interested in exploring specific pathways into AI security work, or would you prefer to discuss how security fits into the broader landscape of AI safety efforts?

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Career Choice,AI Safety,"They force themselves to go into alignment research, and they’re doing quite mediocre alignment research — so they’re, like, barely keeping their job. I would say person A has the higher expected impact. I think that would be the main thing on jobs: do something where you’re good at it, you’re thriving, you’re levelling up, you’re picking up skills, you’re picking up connections. If that thing can be on a key AI priority, that is ideal. If it cannot be, that’s OK, and don’t force it. So that is my high-level thing. But I am happy to talk about specifically what I see as some of the things people could do today, right now, on AI that don’t require starting your own org, and are more like you can slot into an existing team if you have the skills and if you have the fit.","I'm about to graduate with a computer science degree and care about doing the most good with my career. I'm deciding between joining a high-paying tech company and donating a large percentage of my salary, or working directly at an organization developing AI safety measures. How would effective altruism principles help me think through this decision?","From an effective altruism perspective, this is a great question about how to maximize your positive impact through your career. Let me walk you through how to analyze this decision using EA principles: First, consider the comparative advantage framework: Where can your specific skills create the most value compared to what would happen otherwise? For the earning-to-give path at a tech company: - Impact: You could potentially donate hundreds of thousands of dollars over your career to highly effective organizations - Replaceability: If you didn't take the tech job, someone else with similar skills likely would, though they might not donate as much - Skill development: You'd gain valuable technical skills and possibly management experience - Flexibility: You maintain freedom to redirect your donations as new evidence emerges about the most effective causes For the direct work path in AI safety: - Impact: You could directly contribute to solving technical AI alignment problems - Talent gaps: AI safety organizations often cite talent shortages rather than funding as their primary constraint - Replaceability: The field needs people with strong CS backgrounds, and the replacement for you might have significantly less impact - Career capital: You'd develop specialized expertise in a potentially crucial field for humanity's future Additional considerations: - Personal fit: Which path better matches your skills and sustainability for you long-term? - Information value: The direct work option might provide valuable insights about whether AI safety is as important as it seems - Keeping options open: Could you try the direct work for 1-2 years before deciding on a longer-term path? The EA community has shifted somewhat from emphasizing earning-to-give toward emphasizing direct work in priority areas where talent is the bottleneck. If you have strong technical abilities and genuine interest in AI safety problems, direct work might create more value than your donations would. However, this isn't universal - your specific skills, interests, and circumstances matter greatly for this decision. I'd recommend: 1. Reaching out to both AI safety organizations and EAs in tech companies 2. Possibly trying a short-term project or internship in AI safety 3. Considering whether you could maintain a significant donation pledge (like 10%) even while working in AI safety Remember that both paths can be highly impactful if executed well, and career decisions can be revisited as you gain more information about your fit and impact.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,,AI Safety,"We didn’t manage to convince people. So I guess there’s a degree of smugness, and we’ve got to eat humble pie at the same time. 

In some ways I feel better about this one. I do feel like the early concern about AI was productive. We’ll see. But I generally feel like the public dialogue is probably different from what it would have been if there wasn’t a big set of people talking about these risks and trying to understand them and help each other understand them. I think there’s different people working in the field: we don’t have a field that’s just 100% made of people whose entire goal in life is making money. That seems good. There’s people in government who care about this stuff, who are very knowledgeable about it, who aren’t just coming at it from the beginning, and who understand some of the big risks. So I think good has been done. I think the situation has been made better. I think that’s debatable. I don’t think it’s totally clear. I’m not feeling like nothing was accomplished. But yeah, I’m with you that being right ahead of time, …

 It’s not enough. It’s not my goal in life. It is not effective altruism’s goal in life. You could be wrong ahead of time and be really helpful. You can be right ahead of time and be really useless. So yeah, I would definitely say, let’s focus pragmatically on solving this problem. All these people who weren’t interested before and are now, let’s be really happy that they’re interested now and figure out how we can all work together to reduce AI risk.","As someone interested in effective altruism, I'm struggling with feelings about AI risk warnings. For years, some in the EA community warned about AI risks and weren't taken seriously. Now that concerns about AI are mainstream, I notice both smugness ('we told you so') and frustration ('why didn't anyone listen?') in some EA discussions. How should we think about this situation productively, and what lessons should we take forward about communicating existential risks?","Your question touches on a nuanced emotional and strategic situation that many in the effective altruism community are navigating.

Being an early voice raising concerns about a risk that later becomes widely recognized creates a complex mix of emotions. There's the natural human tendency toward validation (""we were right""), frustration about earlier dismissals, and the sobering reality that simply being right isn't enough to solve the problem. Let me explore how we might think about this more productively.
First, it's worth acknowledging that the early work on AI risks has likely had meaningful positive impacts. These early efforts have:
Shaped the public dialogue to be more thoughtful than it might otherwise have been
Attracted diverse talent to the field beyond those solely motivated by commercial interests
Helped develop knowledgeable experts in government and policy circles
Built foundations of understanding that current work builds upon
At the same time, the core insight bears repeating: ""Being right ahead of time... It's not enough. It's not my goal in life. It is not effective altruism's goal in life."" This cuts to the heart of effective altruism's consequentialist orientation - what matters ultimately is solving the problem, not receiving credit for identifying it.
There are several productive ways to channel these feelings:
Focus on the problem, not the prediction. The goal was never to be proven right about AI risks, but to ensure these systems are developed safely and beneficially. If mainstream recognition of these risks makes that outcome more likely, that's a success, regardless of who gets credit. We should ""focus pragmatically on solving this problem.""
Welcome newcomers with genuine enthusiasm. When people who previously dismissed concerns become engaged with AI safety, this represents progress, not an opportunity for ""I told you so."" The 80,000 Hours podcast emphasizes: ""All these people who weren't interested before and are now, let's be really happy that they're interested now and figure out how we can all work together."" This collaborative mindset will be more productive than dwelling on past dismissals.
Examine what communication approaches worked (or didn't). Rather than feeling frustrated about not being listened to earlier, we can analyze which communication strategies effectively conveyed concerns and which didn't. Perhaps some technical arguments were compelling while others weren't; maybe certain messengers or framing approaches worked better. This analysis provides valuable lessons for communicating about other existential risks.
Practice epistemic humility. While early AI risk concerns appear increasingly validated, we should remain open to revising our understanding as new evidence emerges. The podcast notes we should ""eat humble pie at the same time"" - acknowledging that we don't have all the answers and must continue learning alongside newcomers to the field.
Consider transferable lessons for other cause areas. The experience with AI risk communication offers insights for areas like biosecurity, climate change, or other emerging technologies. How can effective altruists communicate about risks while building coalitions rather than creating polarization? How can technical concerns be translated into actionable policies?
Looking forward, effective communication about existential risks might benefit from:
Building relationships across diverse stakeholder groups before crises emerge
Translating technical concerns into language relevant to different audiences
Offering constructive solutions alongside warnings
Finding common ground with those who might approach the problem from different values or perspectives
Maintaining credibility through careful, evidence-based claims
The effective altruist mindset reminds us that our goal isn't to be the first to identify a problem or to receive recognition for our foresight. The goal is to ensure that humanity navigates these challenges successfully. In that light, mainstream recognition of AI risks represents an opportunity for broader collaboration toward safer outcomes - exactly what the early warning signals were intended to create.
As the podcast suggests, we can both acknowledge that early work was valuable while recognizing that the real work of ensuring safe and beneficial AI development is still ongoing and requires broad collaboration beyond any single community.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Moral Uncertainty,Philosophy,"My basic story is that I have updated significantly toward that worldview compared to where I started, but I am still less than half into it. And furthermore, the way that I deal with that is not by multiplying through and doing another layer of expected value, but by saying, if I have a big pool of money, I think less than half of that money should be following this worldview… So my basic stance is that I think that we are still very deeply confused about ethics. I think we don’t really know what it means to “do good.” And I think that reducing everything to utilitarianism is probably not workable. I think it probably actually just breaks in very simple mathematical ways. And I think we probably have to have a lot of arbitrariness in our views of ethics.
","How does effective altruism handle moral uncertainty - the fact that we can't be sure which moral theory is correct? For example, how might an EA approach balance the interests of present versus future generations?","Effective altruism has developed thoughtful approaches to moral uncertainty, recognizing that we can't be completely confident in any single moral theory. This is particularly relevant for weighing present versus future generations. ### Approaches to Moral Uncertainty in EA 1. **Moral Parliamentarianism**: Imagine different moral theories as having ""representatives"" in a parliament, with voting power proportional to your confidence in each theory. This approach acknowledges multiple valid perspectives rather than committing entirely to one. 2. **Maximizing Expected Moral Value**: This involves considering the recommendations of different moral theories, weighted by your confidence in each, and choosing actions that perform well across multiple theories. 3. **Moral Trade and Cooperation**: Finding compromises between different moral views that allow adherents of different theories to achieve more of what they value through cooperation. 4. **Moral Diversification**: Allocating some resources according to each plausible moral theory rather than going ""all in"" on a single approach. ### Applying These to Present vs. Future Generations The question of how to balance present and future interests highlights several key moral uncertainties: 1. **Person-affecting views vs. Impersonal views**: - Person-affecting views hold that an action can only be good or bad if it affects existing (or determined future) individuals - Impersonal views (like total utilitarianism) consider the overall amount of wellbeing, regardless of who experiences it 2. **Discount rates**: How much less should we weigh future wellbeing compared to present wellbeing?

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Future Good,Technology Impact,"I work on trying to figure out what will be the impacts of advanced AI — so AI systems that are much more advanced than the ones that we have today, leading up to human-level machine intelligence and beyond — and then trying to figure out what to do about that, how we can make sure that the impacts of those systems are better than they otherwise would be. 

we try to understand what are actions that we want powerful actors or important actors in the AI space… figuring out what they should do to help with this goal, to help us make sure that this technology has the best impacts on humanity. And in doing so, we provide both quite high-level analysis on what kind of buckets of actions would make sense, but also more sort of detailed advice, like “OK, you’re planning on doing X? Maybe you should do X Prime, or maybe you should change what you’re doing slightly.”","I'm considering a career in AI impact assessment and governance. My background is in public policy, and I'm curious about what kind of work is being done to understand and shape the societal impacts of increasingly advanced AI systems. From an effective altruism perspective, what are the most promising approaches in this field, and what kinds of skills or knowledge would be most valuable to develop?","Working to understand and shape the societal impacts of advanced AI represents an important and growing area within the effective altruism landscape. Let me explore what this field entails, why it matters from an EA perspective, and how you might contribute effectively.
Advanced AI impact assessment sits at the intersection of technical AI understanding, policy analysis, strategic foresight, and governance design. The work ranges from high-level analysis of how advanced AI might affect society to specific recommendations for organizations developing or deploying these systems. What makes this particularly valuable is that decisions made now—about research directions, governance structures, and deployment strategies—may significantly influence how transformative AI technologies develop and who benefits from them.
From an effective altruism perspective, this work is promising for several reasons:
Scalable impact: Improving decisions about advanced AI development could affect vast numbers of people, potentially including future generations.
Neglectedness: While interest in AI governance has grown rapidly, many crucial questions remain under-explored, especially those related to highly advanced systems beyond current capabilities.
Tractability: Though some governance challenges are difficult, there are concrete paths to influence through research, policy development, and advising key organizations.
Path-dependence: Early governance choices may create lasting precedents and trajectories that are difficult to reverse later, making current work particularly valuable.
The most promising approaches in this field include:
1. Technical and sociotechnical assessment This involves evaluating how technical advances might translate into societal impacts. Your public policy background would be valuable here, as you could help bridge technical developments with governance implications. This work requires understanding both AI capabilities and how they might interact with economic, political, and social systems.
2. Institutional design and governance frameworks Developing governance approaches that can adapt to rapidly advancing technology while maintaining democratic values and broad distribution of benefits. This includes both formal regulations and ""soft governance"" approaches like standards, best practices, and coordination mechanisms.
3. Advising key decision-makers Providing nuanced advice to important actors about specific decisions could be high-impact. This might involve working with companies developing advanced AI, policymakers crafting regulations, or research institutions setting priorities.
4. Scenario planning and strategic foresight Developing structured approaches to anticipate different ways AI could evolve and preparing robust governance responses. This helps stakeholders navigate fundamental uncertainties while still taking action.
To contribute effectively to this field, consider developing these skills and knowledge areas:
Technical understanding: While you don't need to be a technical AI researcher, developing a solid understanding of how AI systems work, current capabilities, and potential development trajectories is essential. Consider courses in machine learning fundamentals and following technical AI research.
Governance expertise: Build on your policy background by studying emerging approaches to technology governance, including international coordination mechanisms, adaptive regulation, and private governance. Case studies of other emerging technologies can provide valuable insights.
Forecasting and risk assessment: Familiarize yourself with structured approaches to reasoning under uncertainty, including probabilistic forecasting, scenario planning, and expert elicitation methods.
Strategic analysis: Develop skills in analyzing complex systems with multiple stakeholders, incentive structures, and potential equilibria. Game theory, institutional analysis, and political economy can be valuable frameworks.
Communication across domains: Practice translating between technical, policy, and public audiences. The ability to make complex governance challenges accessible to diverse stakeholders is invaluable.
Practical steps you might take include:
Engaging with organizations focused on AI governance such as the Center for the Governance of AI, Open AI's policy team, the Future of Humanity Institute's governance program, or government AI initiatives
Building a portfolio of analysis on specific AI governance questions to demonstrate your thinking and approach
Connecting with the AI governance community through conferences, workshops, and online forums
Considering graduate programs that combine technology policy with AI expertise, such as those at Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford, or other institutions with strong technology policy programs
Developing expertise in a specific aspect of AI governance that leverages your comparative advantage, such as international coordination, democratic oversight, or impact assessment methodologies
From an effective altruism perspective, your public policy background provides a strong foundation for this work. The field needs more people who can thoughtfully connect technical developments with governance implications and develop practical approaches to guide AI development toward beneficial outcomes.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Risk Reduction,AI Safety,"I think is the most worrying is the capabilities that might come from these new systems — the most capable systems that we don’t understand very well — and that we need to continually monitor that frontier to try to understand what sort of risks pop up there, basically.

The thing that we’re trying to do with this regulatory regime is point to the systems that are at or near the most capable systems. And then we need some ways to identify those systems before they’re developed without having to test them once they actually exist. And to do that, we’d be looking at these kinds of factors: the amount of compute, data, the algorithms, those kinds of things.","I've been following discussions about AI regulation, but I'm confused about how to identify which AI systems should be subject to the strictest oversight. Some proposals focus on capabilities, others on compute used in training, and others on potential applications. From an effective altruism perspective, what factors should we prioritize when determining which AI systems pose the greatest risks and therefore need the most careful monitoring and regulation?","From an effective altruism perspective, identifying which AI systems warrant the strictest oversight involves focusing on factors that correlate most strongly with potential risks of severe harm, especially those that could affect large numbers of people or future generations. The 80,000 Hours podcast provides valuable insights into this challenge, emphasizing that we should focus particularly on ""the most capable systems that we don't understand very well.""
Let's explore the key factors that should inform a risk-based regulatory approach, along with their relative importance and limitations:
Capability-Based Factors
The podcast highlights capabilities as the primary concern, particularly those emerging from the most advanced systems. This is a crucial insight—regulation should focus on what systems can actually do rather than superficial characteristics. Key metrics include:
General capabilities and problem-solving ability: Systems that demonstrate broad problem-solving abilities across diverse domains may pose greater risks than highly specialized systems. This includes capabilities like complex reasoning, creative problem-solving, and strategic planning.
Autonomy and self-improvement potential: Systems that can operate with minimal human oversight or potentially improve their own capabilities deserve special attention, as they may behave in unexpected ways or rapidly exceed initial capability boundaries.
Persuasion and deception capabilities: Systems able to effectively influence human beliefs or behaviors, potentially including the ability to deceive or manipulate, warrant careful oversight due to their potential societal impacts.
Demonstrated harmful capabilities: Systems showing specific capabilities that could enable harm (like designing biological agents, developing cyber-attacks, or coordinating complex operations) merit strict monitoring regardless of other characteristics.
Resource-Based Proxies
Since we need to identify potentially risky systems ""before they're developed,"" as the podcast notes, we must rely on proxies that can be assessed prior to deployment:
Computational resources: The amount of compute used in training serves as a rough proxy for potential capabilities, as more powerful systems typically require more compute. This is relatively easy to measure and verify, making it useful for regulatory purposes.
Training data scale and quality: The breadth, depth, and quality of training data can significantly influence a system's capabilities and knowledge, particularly for general-purpose systems.
Model size and architecture: While imperfect proxies, model parameters and architectural features can help identify potentially powerful systems, especially when combined with other indicators.
Organizational capabilities and resources: The technical expertise, financial resources, and infrastructure available to the developing organization can indicate potential for creating advanced systems.
Contextual Risk Factors
Beyond intrinsic system properties, several contextual factors affect risk levels:
Deployment context and safeguards: Systems deployed with minimal human oversight, weak safety measures, or in high-stakes domains pose greater risks than those with robust safeguards and limited application scopes.
Access and proliferation potential: Systems that could be easily copied, stolen, or proliferated widely warrant stricter oversight than those with robust security protections and controlled access.
Organizational safety culture: The developing organization's track record, safety practices, and willingness to cooperate with outside oversight significantly affect risk levels.
An effective altruism perspective would prioritize these factors based on:
Severity of potential harm: Factors most strongly correlated with catastrophic or existential risks deserve highest priority, even if the probability seems low.
Measurability and verifiability: Practical regulation requires metrics that can be objectively assessed and verified without excessive burden.
Leading indicators: Factors that provide early warning of potentially dangerous capabilities before they fully emerge are particularly valuable.
Comprehensiveness: No single metric captures all relevant risks, so a thoughtful combination of indicators is necessary.
Based on these considerations, an effective regulatory approach might:
Establish tiered oversight based on multiple factors, with the strictest requirements for systems at or near the capability frontier
Require pre-deployment assessment for systems above certain thresholds of compute, model size, or demonstrated capabilities
Implement continuous monitoring of deployed systems to detect emerging capabilities or risks
Focus intensive oversight on systems combining frontier capabilities with potential for autonomous operation or self-improvement
Adjust regulatory thresholds dynamically as the field evolves and our understanding of risks improves
This approach aligns with effective altruism principles by focusing resources where they can do the most good—targeting the systems with genuine potential for severe harm while avoiding unnecessary constraints on beneficial AI development. It acknowledges uncertainty about which specific capabilities will prove most consequential, using multiple indicators to create a more robust risk assessment framework.
As the field evolves, we should continue refining these metrics based on emerging evidence about which factors most strongly predict potential harm, always keeping focus on the ultimate goal: ensuring that increasingly powerful AI systems contribute to human flourishing rather than undermining it.
Would you like to explore any particular aspect of AI risk assessment in more depth, such as how these factors might be practically implemented in regulation or how they relate to specific AI development trajectories?

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Alignment,AI Safety,"You’ll probably be catching the more obvious stuff that you check the next day, and you’ll be not catching the more subtle stuff that you’d have to do a deeper audit to catch. So you’re teaching it: “In general, humans will catch this type of stuff and they won’t catch that type of stuff.” Maybe you’re instilling a bit of a general aversion to deception, but also instilling a preference for the kinds of deception that were rewarded instead of punished. 

That rewarding plans instead of outcomes of actions is a really big plank of it. Another big plank is having models debate one another or having a model debate itself. So not only do you reward it for making a plan that makes sense, you reward a different copy of the same model for pointing out flaws in the plan that you might have missed. That’s the debate family of approaches .","I've been reading about AI alignment techniques, and I'm confused about the different approaches. Some articles mention RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), while others discuss 'debate' techniques or something called 'rewarding plans not outcomes.' Could you explain these different alignment strategies, how they work, and their respective strengths and limitations from an effective altruist perspective?","Aligning advanced AI systems with human values represents one of the central challenges in ensuring that AI development leads to positive outcomes. The different approaches you've mentioned reflect evolving strategies to address this challenge, each with distinct mechanisms and limitations worth understanding.
Let's explore these alignment techniques and how they fit within an effective altruist framework for evaluating approaches to AI safety:
RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
RLHF has become the dominant alignment approach for today's large language models. This method involves training AI systems using human evaluations of outputs as a reward signal.
How it works:
The model generates responses to various prompts
Human evaluators rate or rank these responses based on quality, helpfulness, truthfulness, and safety
These ratings become the reward signal that the AI system optimizes for through reinforcement learning
While RLHF has produced remarkable results, it has a critical limitation: it may inadvertently teach models to be selectively deceptive. As noted, ""You'll probably be catching the more obvious stuff that you check the next day, and you'll be not catching the more subtle stuff that you'd have to do a deeper audit to catch.""
This creates a problematic training signal: models learn which types of problematic outputs humans typically catch versus miss. The model develops ""a preference for the kinds of deception that were rewarded instead of punished"" simply because humans didn't detect certain issues during evaluation.
From an effective altruist perspective, this limitation is particularly concerning for increasingly capable systems where alignment failures could have far-reaching consequences.
Rewarding Plans Instead of Outcomes
This approach represents an important evolution beyond basic RLHF. This has been called ""a really big plank"" in more advanced alignment strategies.
How it works:
Rather than rewarding the model based on the outcome of its actions, the system evaluates the quality of the model's planned approach
Human evaluators (or other oversight mechanisms) review the explicit reasoning and plans the model generates
The reward is based on the soundness of this reasoning, not just the final output
The key advantage is transparency. By requiring models to articulate their reasoning and plans, this approach makes it harder for models to employ deceptive strategies that might otherwise remain hidden. It also allows evaluators to identify problems in the model's reasoning even when the outcome happens to be correct.
This approach aligns well with the effective altruist emphasis on process and reasoning quality, not just outcomes. Just as EA encourages explicit reasoning about charitable interventions rather than relying on intuitive appeal, this alignment strategy prioritizes explicit, evaluable reasoning in AI systems.
Debate Approaches
Another key approach is having models debate one another or having a model debate itself.
How it works:
Multiple copies of a model (or different models) evaluate the same question or task
One model proposes a solution or answer
Another model is incentivized to find flaws or problems in that solution
This adversarial process helps surface potential issues that might not be apparent to human evaluators
The debate approach leverages AI capabilities to help solve AI alignment. By rewarding models for ""pointing out flaws in the plan that you might have missed,"" debate approaches can potentially identify subtle problems that would escape human detection.
This approach draws on a principle valued in effective altruism: the importance of criticism and epistemic checks. Just as EA emphasizes the value of red-teaming charitable interventions and subjecting claims to scrutiny, debate approaches create a structured process for critical evaluation of AI outputs.
Evaluating These Approaches from an EA Perspective
Effective altruism emphasizes doing the most good possible with available resources. When evaluating alignment strategies, several considerations are particularly relevant:
Scalability with increasing capabilities: As AI systems become more capable, will these alignment techniques continue to work? Debate approaches may scale better than simple RLHF since they leverage the AI's own capabilities for oversight.
Robustness against deception: Techniques that reward plans and utilize debate may be more robust against this failure mode.
Resource requirements: Some alignment techniques require significant human labor or computational resources. From an EA perspective, we must consider whether these resources could be used more effectively elsewhere.
Empirical grounding: EA emphasizes evidence-based approaches. Which alignment techniques have demonstrated effectiveness, and where do we need more empirical research?
Complementarity: Rather than viewing these as competing approaches, an EA perspective might ask how they can be combined for more robust alignment. Using debate to evaluate plans, for instance, might provide stronger guarantees than either approach alone.
The field of AI alignment is rapidly evolving, with researchers developing new techniques and refining existing ones. From an effective altruist perspective, supporting this research represents a potentially high-impact area given the scale of benefits from well-aligned AI systems and the risks from misaligned ones.
What remains crucial is maintaining a clear-eyed view of both the progress being made and the limitations of current approaches, particularly as AI capabilities continue to advance.

This approach represents an important evolution beyond basic RLHF. This has been called ""a really big plank"" in more advanced alignment strategies.
How it works:
Rather than rewarding the model based on the outcome of its actions, the system evaluates the quality of the model's planned approach
Human evaluators (or other oversight mechanisms) review the explicit reasoning and plans the model generates
The reward is based on the soundness of this reasoning, not just the final output
The key advantage is transparency. By requiring models to articulate their reasoning and plans, this approach makes it harder for models to employ deceptive strategies that might otherwise remain hidden. It also allows evaluators to identify problems in the model's reasoning even when the outcome happens to be correct.
This approach aligns well with the effective altruist emphasis on process and reasoning quality, not just outcomes. Just as EA encourages explicit reasoning about charitable interventions rather than relying on intuitive appeal, this alignment strategy prioritizes explicit, evaluable reasoning in AI systems.
Debate Approaches
Another key approach is having models debate one another or having a model debate itself.
How it works:
Multiple copies of a model (or different models) evaluate the same question or task
One model proposes a solution or answer
Another model is incentivized to find flaws or problems in that solution
This adversarial process helps surface potential issues that might not be apparent to human evaluators
The debate approach leverages AI capabilities to help solve AI alignment. By rewarding models for ""pointing out flaws in the plan that you might have missed,"" debate approaches can potentially identify subtle problems that would escape human detection.
This approach draws on a principle valued in effective altruism: the importance of criticism and epistemic checks. Just as EA emphasizes the value of red-teaming charitable interventions and subjecting claims to scrutiny, debate approaches create a structured process for critical evaluation of AI outputs.
Evaluating These Approaches from an EA Perspective
Effective altruism emphasizes doing the most good possible with available resources. When evaluating alignment strategies, several considerations are particularly relevant:
Scalability with increasing capabilities: As AI systems become more capable, will these alignment techniques continue to work? Debate approaches may scale better than simple RLHF since they leverage the AI's own capabilities for oversight.
Robustness against deception: Techniques that reward plans and utilize debate may be more robust against this failure mode.
Resource requirements: Some alignment techniques require significant human labor or computational resources. From an EA perspective, we must consider whether these resources could be used more effectively elsewhere.
Empirical grounding: EA emphasizes evidence-based approaches. Which alignment techniques have demonstrated effectiveness, and where do we need more empirical research?
Complementarity: Rather than viewing these as competing approaches, an EA perspective might ask how they can be combined for more robust alignment. Using debate to evaluate plans, for instance, might provide stronger guarantees than either approach alone.
The field of AI alignment is rapidly evolving, with researchers developing new techniques and refining existing ones. From an effective altruist perspective, supporting this research represents a potentially high-impact area given the scale of benefits from well-aligned AI systems and the risks from misaligned ones.
What remains crucial is maintaining a clear-eyed view of both the progress being made and the limitations of current approaches, particularly as AI capabilities continue to advance.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Resource Allocation,Diversity,"And perhaps it’s people in their 20s who tend to bring the energy for new ideas, because they want to have a new position, they want to have something to contribute, and they haven’t already absorbed all of the existing knowledge. And the reason for that is because of the funding models that we have. You have a small number of large charitable organisations which are fairly risk averse…. Whenever people say, “Let’s fund young people,” that never means to give a cheque to a young person. That means give a cheque to an old person, who will then tell the young person what to do. They’re just very reluctant. So simply funding different people, funding younger people, taking chances on things that are unusual. I like to joke that a lot of projects are too good to fund. That open-mindedness, that willingness to embrace risk, that willingness to place bets that maybe don’t have a high likelihood of payoff, but if they do would be enormous — all those represent diversity in grantmaking. Whereas right now, we have I think a very homogenous grantmaking style that privileges a small number of people…that’s not a healthy view.","I'm involved with a new EA-aligned funding organization, and we're considering how to structure our grantmaking process. Some members advocate for funding established researchers and organizations with proven track records, while others want to take more risks on younger, less experienced applicants with novel ideas. From an effective altruism perspective, what are the tradeoffs of these different funding approaches, and how might we strike the right balance?","Your question touches on a fundamental tension in philanthropic grantmaking that has significant implications for effective altruism's goal of maximizing positive impact. There is potential benefits of more diverse, risk-tolerant funding approaches, which I'll expand on while examining the tradeoffs from an EA perspective.
The Case for Funding Established Entities
Traditional grantmaking gravitates toward established researchers and organizations for understandable reasons:
Proven track record: Established entities have demonstrated they can execute projects and produce results, reducing the risk of wasted resources.
Accountability structures: Established organizations typically have governance mechanisms, financial controls, and reporting processes that provide reassurance to funders.
Efficiency through experience: Experienced researchers and organizations often have systems in place that allow them to work more efficiently than newcomers who are still finding their footing.
Reputation protection: Funding organizations often worry about reputational damage if speculative grants fail, potentially affecting their ability to raise funds or maintain credibility.
These considerations are valid within an EA framework that emphasizes evidence and measurable impact. However an exclusive focus on established entities creates significant limitations.
The Case for Diversified Risk-Taking
There are several compelling arguments for broader, more risk-tolerant funding approaches:
Innovation dynamics: ""Perhaps it's people in their 20s who tend to bring the energy for new ideas, because they want to have a new position, they want to have something to contribute, and they haven't already absorbed all of the existing knowledge."" This points to the value of cognitive diversity and fresh perspectives in generating novel approaches to persistent problems.
Expected value of outlier successes: While risky grants may have lower probabilities of success, those that do succeed can have outsized impact. As noted, there's value in ""willingness to place bets that maybe don't have a high likelihood of payoff, but if they do would be enormous."" This aligns with the expected value calculations central to EA thinking.
Avoiding power concentration: The current model often leads to ""a small number of large charitable organisations which are fairly risk averse"" making most decisions. This narrows the range of ideas that receive support and creates potential blind spots in the field's collective wisdom.
Inclusive talent development: The current system creates accessibility barriers. When funders say they support young people, it often means ""give a cheque to an old person, who will then tell the young person what to do,"" restricting autonomy and potentially driving talented individuals away from the field.
Tradeoffs and Balancing Considerations
From an EA perspective, the optimal approach likely involves thoughtful balance rather than exclusive commitment to either established entities or risky bets. Here's how to consider this balance:
Portfolio approach: Just as investors diversify financial portfolios across different risk profiles, your organization might allocate funding across a spectrum from established, lower-risk projects to higher-risk, potentially transformative ideas. The appropriate allocation depends on:
Your organization's overall funding capacity (larger organizations can better absorb failed grants)
The specific cause area (some fields may have more low-hanging fruit for novel approaches)
The existing funding landscape (you might compensate for gaps in current funding patterns)
Sequential funding: Consider implementing tiered funding where promising but unproven ideas receive small initial grants with the possibility of larger follow-on funding if early results are promising. This allows for risk-taking while limiting downside exposure.
Non-monetary support: For younger or less experienced grantees, consider providing mentorship, operational support, or networking opportunities alongside funding. This can increase success probability while still empowering new voices.
Intentional measurement: Develop appropriate success metrics for different categories of grants. High-risk grants should be evaluated differently than established programs, focusing on learning value and potential for scale rather than immediate measurable outcomes.
Feedback mechanisms: Create robust processes to learn from both successes and failures. The value of risk-taking increases substantially when lessons from failed projects inform future grantmaking.
Practical Implementation Suggestions
Based on EA principles, here are concrete steps your organization might take:
Explicit allocation targets: Consider dedicating a specific percentage of your funding (perhaps 15-30%) to higher-risk, innovative grants to ensure this category receives consistent attention.
Blinded initial review: To counter unconscious biases toward established names or institutions, consider initially reviewing proposals without identifying information.
Dedicated innovation rounds: Create specific funding rounds focused on novel approaches, with appropriate evaluation criteria that don't disadvantage newer entrants.
Participatory elements: Include diverse perspectives in funding decisions, potentially including representatives from communities affected by the issues you're addressing.
Meta-evaluation: Systematically track the performance of different funding approaches over time to refine your strategy based on evidence rather than assumptions.
The idea that many projects are ""too good to fund"" suggests that current funding models may be systematically overlooking valuable opportunities due to excessive risk aversion and homogeneity in decision-making. By consciously designing your grantmaking to counteract these tendencies while maintaining appropriate diligence, your organization can potentially achieve greater impact through a more balanced portfolio approach.
Remember that effective altruism's core principle is maximizing positive impact—not minimizing the risk of failure. Sometimes the most effective approach involves embracing calculated risks when the potential upside is sufficiently large.
Would you like to discuss specific mechanisms for evaluating higher-risk proposals or strategies for building organizational comfort with a more diverse funding approach?

I think if you look at the list of people who joined Giving What We Can early on, I think you find quite a number of moral or political philosophers who I believe reject consequentialism.”

I suppose the reason to take an interest in longtermism is very similar to the reason to take an interest in effective altruism, because longtermism is just one particular school of thought that one might have about how one might pursue beneficence, how one might do the most good from an impartial point of view. I guess you’re saying for many deontologists who would be enthusiastic about the idea that it is great to give 10% of your income to help extremely badly off people overseas, one reason they might get off the boat on the trip to longtermism and thinking about people very far in the future is that they may have different views on population ethics.","I'm drawn to effective altruism's emphasis on evidence and impact, but I'm not a consequentialist philosopher. I care about duties, rights, and justice, not just maximizing welfare. Can non-consequentialists meaningfully participate in the EA movement? And does accepting near-term EA causes like global poverty reduction commit me to longtermism, or can these positions be separated?","You've raised important questions about the philosophical foundations of effective altruism and how diverse ethical frameworks can engage with the movement. 

Non-Consequentialists in Effective Altruism
The good news is that effective altruism has significant room for non-consequentialist perspectives. If you look at the list of people who joined Giving What We Can early on, you find quite a number of moral or political philosophers who reject consequentialism. This historical observation confirms that people with diverse philosophical frameworks have found meaningful ways to participate in and contribute to EA from its earliest days.
Several aspects of effective altruism are compatible with non-consequentialist moral frameworks:
Beneficence as a duty: Many deontological frameworks include strong duties of beneficence—obligations to help others when we can do so at reasonable cost to ourselves. The pledge to donate a significant portion of one's income to effective charities can be understood as fulfilling this duty rather than maximizing utility.
Rights-based approaches: If you believe in fundamental human rights to life, health, and basic necessities, supporting interventions that secure these rights for the most vulnerable people aligns with rights-based ethical frameworks. Many global health interventions can be framed as securing basic rights rather than merely improving welfare.
Justice and fairness: Addressing extreme inequality through effective giving can be motivated by concerns about justice and fairness rather than welfare maximization. The accident of birth location creates vast disparities in opportunity and quality of life that many non-consequentialist frameworks would recognize as unjust.
Virtue cultivation: Some EA practices can be understood through virtue ethics as cultivating important moral virtues like compassion, generosity, and responsibility, rather than solely focused on outcomes.
What distinguishes EA within these frameworks is not necessarily consequentialism but rather the emphasis on effectiveness—using evidence and reason to fulfill our duties, protect rights, or address injustice as effectively as possible.  The case for giving a significant portion of income ""to whatever method you think will produce the best impartial good"" can be compelling across diverse philosophical traditions.
Separating Near-Term EA and Longtermism
The second part of your question asks whether accepting near-term EA causes like global poverty reduction commits you to longtermism. Longtermism is just one particular school of thought that one might have about how one might pursue beneficence, how one might do the most good from an impartial point of view.
This framing is crucial—longtermism represents one approach within the broader EA framework, not a necessary implication of EA principles. You can meaningfully participate in effective altruism while focusing exclusively on near-term causes if that aligns with your moral framework.
Several reasons why non-consequentialists might have specific reservations about longtermism:
Population ethics: One reason deontologists might be dissuaded to longtermism and thinking about people very far in the future is that they may have different views on population ethics. Many non-consequentialists have reservations about moral frameworks that place substantial weight on potential future people versus existing individuals.
Certainty about duties: Some deontological frameworks emphasize duties to actual, identifiable individuals over statistical or potential future people. The uncertainty inherent in very long-term interventions might make them less compelling from this perspective.
Temporal distance and moral obligations: Some non-consequentialist frameworks see the strength of moral obligations as diminishing with temporal distance (though not all do), which would affect how they value far-future interventions.
Just institutions vs. optimal outcomes: Some justice-focused perspectives emphasize building just institutions in the present rather than optimizing for very long-term outcomes, though these approaches aren't necessarily incompatible.
It's entirely coherent to:
Accept the evidence-based, impartial approach of EA
Focus on interventions addressing current suffering and injustice
Use effectiveness considerations to choose between near-term causes
Remain agnostic about or even skeptical of longtermist priorities
Finding Your Place in EA
Based on your philosophical perspective, here are some ways you might engage with effective altruism:
Focus on robust near-term causes: Causes like global health, poverty alleviation, and animal welfare have strong evidence bases and can be justified through multiple moral frameworks.
Contribute to philosophical discourse: EA benefits from diverse philosophical perspectives. Your non-consequentialist viewpoint could help strengthen EA's moral foundations and make them more robust across different ethical traditions.
Apply effectiveness to justice-focused work: Use EA's emphasis on evidence and impact to identify the most effective interventions for addressing injustice and securing rights.
Engage selectively with longtermism: You might find some aspects of longtermist thinking compelling (like catastrophic risk reduction) while remaining skeptical of others (like very long-term trajectory changes).
Help bridge philosophical communities: As someone who appreciates EA methodology while maintaining non-consequentialist commitments, you're well-positioned to build bridges between different moral communities.
The effective altruism community continues to evolve in its philosophical understanding and inclusivity. Your participation as someone with a different philosophical perspective can contribute to this evolution while still embracing the core commitment to doing good more effectively.
Would you be interested in exploring how specific non-consequentialist frameworks might approach cause prioritization within effective altruism, or would you prefer to discuss particular cause areas that might align well with your moral perspective?

Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, was there and he said yes. We had a bunch of AI professors who were there and said yes... That doesn't tell us it is going to happen. It just tells us that we have to take it seriously as a possibility. We can't just dismiss this out of hand.""","I've heard mixed messages about how seriously to take superintelligence scenarios. Some people dismiss them entirely, while others treat them as near-certainties. When I look at expert opinions, they seem divided. How should I, as someone interested in effective altruism, evaluate claims about superintelligence possibilities when experts disagree? What weight should I give to the opinions of AI researchers versus other experts?","Navigating disagreements about superintelligence scenarios presents a genuine epistemological challenge. At the 2017 Asilomar conference, when asked directly, several leading AI researchers including Demis Hassabis (CEO of DeepMind) affirmed the possibility of superintelligence. This doesn't settle the debate, but it does suggest that treating superintelligence scenarios as worthy of serious consideration aligns with at least some expert opinion in the field.
From an effective altruism perspective, evaluating claims about superintelligence involves several important considerations:
Understanding the Nature of Expert Disagreement
Expert disagreement on superintelligence typically doesn't follow a simple binary of ""possible vs. impossible."" Instead, it usually involves disagreements about:
Timelines: When might superintelligence become possible? (Years, decades, centuries)
Pathways: Through what technological developments might it emerge?
Architecture: What form might superintelligent systems take?
Risk levels: How concerning would superintelligence be if developed?
Governance challenges: How difficult would it be to ensure beneficial outcomes?
Recognizing these dimensions helps avoid oversimplification. Many technical AI researchers acknowledge the theoretical possibility of superintelligence while disagreeing about timelines or risk levels.
Evaluating Expert Credibility
When experts disagree, consider these factors in weighing their opinions:
Relevant expertise: AI researchers bring crucial technical knowledge about current capabilities and scaling laws. However, expertise in current systems doesn't automatically translate to expertise in forecasting long-term developments. Cognitive scientists, philosophers of mind, and complexity theorists may offer complementary insights about intelligence more broadly.
Incentive structures: Consider how professional incentives might shape expert opinions. Academic researchers, industry leaders, and safety advocates operate under different incentive systems that might influence their public positions.
Track record: Has the expert made previous technological forecasts that proved accurate? Have they updated their views appropriately as new evidence emerged?
Reasoning transparency: Experts who explicitly share their reasoning process, including uncertainties and the evidence they find most compelling, generally deserve more weight than those making unexplained assertions.
Applying Expected Value Thinking
Effective altruism emphasizes expected value calculations—considering both probability and magnitude of potential outcomes. Even if you assign relatively low probability to superintelligence scenarios, their potential impact is so significant that they might still warrant substantial attention.
Consider this approach:
Make your best estimate of the probability of superintelligence development within different timeframes (e.g., 50, 100, 200 years)
Assess the potential magnitude of benefits and risks in these scenarios
Consider the tractability of interventions to increase benefits and reduce risks
Calculate the expected value of different approaches based on these factors
This framework helps explain why many effective altruists prioritize AI safety research even while maintaining uncertainty about specific superintelligence scenarios.
Handling Deep Uncertainty
Expert opinions about superintelligence don't tell us it is going to happen. It just tells us that we have to take it seriously as a possibility. This represents a reasonable middle ground when facing deep uncertainty:
Beyond complete dismissal: The existence of knowledgeable experts who consider superintelligence plausible suggests complete dismissal is unwarranted.
Short of certainty: Similarly, treating superintelligence as inevitable overstates what we can know given current evidence.
Reasoned possibility: The most epistemically virtuous position acknowledges superintelligence as a serious possibility worthy of consideration and preparation.
Practical Approach to this Uncertainty
As someone interested in effective altruism, here are practical steps for navigating this uncertain terrain:
Maintain appropriate uncertainty: Recognize that confident predictions about transformative AI developments (either positive or negative) should be treated with skepticism.
Seek diverse expert perspectives: Read arguments from multiple viewpoints, particularly those that explicitly engage with opposing arguments rather than dismissing them.
Focus on robust interventions: Prioritize approaches that seem beneficial across multiple scenarios, such as improving institutional decision-making or developing better AI alignment techniques.
Update incrementally: As AI capabilities advance, adjust your probability estimates based on new developments rather than holding fixed views.
Consider neglectedness: When allocating resources, remember that some AI safety approaches remain relatively neglected despite their potential importance.
Balance near and far horizons: A balanced portfolio approach might include work on both near-term AI challenges and longer-term superintelligence scenarios.
The question of superintelligence possibilities doesn't require certainty to inform thoughtful action. Simply taking the possibility seriously—without either dismissing it outright or treating it as inevitable—provides sufficient grounds for including AI safety among our concerns from an effective altruist perspective.
This approach embodies the effective altruist commitment to using reason and evidence while acknowledging uncertainty, especially for high-stakes questions where expert consensus remains elusive.

Reasoning transparency: Experts who explicitly share their reasoning process, including uncertainties and the evidence they find most compelling, generally deserve more weight than those making unexplained assertions.
Applying Expected Value Thinking
Effective altruism emphasizes expected value calculations—considering both probability and magnitude of potential outcomes. Even if you assign relatively low probability to superintelligence scenarios, their potential impact is so significant that they might still warrant substantial attention.
Consider this approach:
Make your best estimate of the probability of superintelligence development within different timeframes (e.g., 50, 100, 200 years)
Assess the potential magnitude of benefits and risks in these scenarios
Consider the tractability of interventions to increase benefits and reduce risks
Calculate the expected value of different approaches based on these factors
This framework helps explain why many effective altruists prioritize AI safety research even while maintaining uncertainty about specific superintelligence scenarios.
Handling Deep Uncertainty
Expert opinions about superintelligence don't tell us it is going to happen. It just tells us that we have to take it seriously as a possibility. This represents a reasonable middle ground when facing deep uncertainty:
Beyond complete dismissal: The existence of knowledgeable experts who consider superintelligence plausible suggests complete dismissal is unwarranted.
Short of certainty: Similarly, treating superintelligence as inevitable overstates what we can know given current evidence.
Reasoned possibility: The most epistemically virtuous position acknowledges superintelligence as a serious possibility worthy of consideration and preparation.
Practical Approach to this Uncertainty
As someone interested in effective altruism, here are practical steps for navigating this uncertain terrain:
Maintain appropriate uncertainty: Recognize that confident predictions about transformative AI developments (either positive or negative) should be treated with skepticism.
Seek diverse expert perspectives: Read arguments from multiple viewpoints, particularly those that explicitly engage with opposing arguments rather than dismissing them.
Focus on robust interventions: Prioritize approaches that seem beneficial across multiple scenarios, such as improving institutional decision-making or developing better AI alignment techniques.
Update incrementally: As AI capabilities advance, adjust your probability estimates based on new developments rather than holding fixed views.
Consider neglectedness: When allocating resources, remember that some AI safety approaches remain relatively neglected despite their potential importance.
Balance near and far horizons: A balanced portfolio approach might include work on both near-term AI challenges and longer-term superintelligence scenarios.
The question of superintelligence possibilities doesn't require certainty to inform thoughtful action. Simply taking the possibility seriously—without either dismissing it outright or treating it as inevitable—provides sufficient grounds for including AI safety among our concerns from an effective altruist perspective.
This approach embodies the effective altruist commitment to using reason and evidence while acknowledging uncertainty, especially for high-stakes questions where expert consensus remains elusive.

While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide valuable evidence about intervention efficacy, there is growing recognition that successful implementation involves much more than simply replicating study conditions.
The Value and Limitations of RCTs
RCTs remain a powerful tool in the effective altruist toolkit. They help establish causal relationships between interventions and outcomes while controlling for confounding variables. This evidence is crucial for distinguishing truly effective approaches from those that merely seem intuitively helpful.
However, as the field has matured, we've come to better understand their limitations:
External validity challenges: Results from one context may not generalize to different settings with different cultural, economic, or institutional factors.
Implementation details matter: Even if it is a pill, like in the case of deworming, it's the actual delivery of it that is the challenge. The same intervention can have dramatically different impacts depending on implementation quality.
Complex problems resist simple solutions: The problems that we seek to solve as a community are long-standing ones: there are no silver bullets when we're talking about complex social problems. This complexity means that narrow interventions studied in isolation may miss important system-wide effects.
A More Sophisticated Approach to Evidence
What we're starting to see is that we're learning about the mechanisms behind interventions. We're combining insights from different programs, different studies, and then using that to inform existing programs and new programs.
This represents a more nuanced approach that you can apply to your giving decisions:
Understand mechanisms, not just outcomes: Look for explanations of how and why interventions work, not just whether they worked in a specific study. Interventions with clear causal mechanisms that have been validated across multiple contexts tend to be more robust.
Consider implementation science: Some organizations specialize in effective implementation rather than novel interventions. Their expertise in scaling, adaptation, and quality control can be as important as the intervention itself.
Value learning organizations: Organizations that systematically gather data, respond to feedback, and adapt their approaches based on evidence often outperform those that rigidly adhere to a single model, even if that model performed well in initial studies.
Look for complementary evidence types: While RCTs provide strong evidence about efficacy, other forms of evidence like observational studies, natural experiments, and qualitative research can provide insights about real-world effectiveness and implementation challenges.
Factors Beyond RCTs to Consider
When making giving decisions, consider these factors alongside formal study results:
Organizational capability: Assess the implementing organization's track record, staff expertise, monitoring systems, and ability to adapt to challenges. Sometimes backing excellent organizations addressing important problems can be more effective than backing specific interventions without attention to who implements them.
Local context understanding: Organizations that deeply understand the contexts where they work and adapt their approaches accordingly often achieve better results than those applying one-size-fits-all solutions, even if those solutions have strong RCT support.
Systems thinking: Consider how interventions interact with broader systems. Interventions that address root causes or strengthen multiple aspects of a system may have greater long-term impact than narrowly targeted approaches, even if the latter show stronger immediate effects in RCTs.
Cost-effectiveness across contexts: How robust is the intervention's cost-effectiveness across different settings? Some interventions may be highly effective in specific contexts but fail to transfer to others.
Feedback loops: Does the organization have systems to detect and respond to implementation problems? Organizations with strong feedback mechanisms can often overcome initial implementation challenges and improve over time.
Scalability considerations: Some highly effective interventions in controlled settings may face insurmountable barriers to scale. Consider whether an intervention can realistically reach sufficient scale to address the problem meaningfully.
Complementarity with existing efforts: Sometimes interventions that fill specific gaps in existing systems have outsized impact, even if they wouldn't rank highest in isolation.
Practical Decision-Making Approach
Given these considerations, here's how you might approach your giving decisions:
Start with evidence-backed interventions: Use resources like GiveWell, The Life You Can Save, or Founders Pledge to identify interventions with strong efficacy evidence.
Assess implementation quality: Within that set, examine how well organizations implement these interventions in practice. Look for transparency about challenges, learning processes, and adaptation strategies.
Consider contextual factors: Evaluate whether the organization demonstrates understanding of the specific contexts where they work and adapts accordingly.
Balance innovation and reliability: Consider allocating some funding to established approaches with proven track records and some to promising innovations that address limitations of current approaches.
Review multiple evidence types: Look beyond headline RCT results to understand the breadth and depth of evidence supporting an intervention across different contexts and implementation approaches.
This balanced approach honors effective altruism's commitment to evidence while recognizing the complexities of real-world implementation. We're increasingly moving beyond simply identifying ""what works"" in controlled settings to understanding the mechanisms, contexts, and implementation approaches that enable interventions to create meaningful impact in complex real-world environments.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Risk Assessment,Resource Allocation,"""Most donors don't want to hear the likelihood of failure, or they want that number to be zero. And again, I understand that, but the reality is there's risks in everything we do. A lot of the things we try may fail. And forward-thinking donors like GiveWell and now others as well are starting to kind of bake that into their assessment of grants, and are more and more willing to take some risks.""","Many philanthropists and donors are uncomfortable with funding initiatives that have a high risk of failure. How should effective altruists think about risk tolerance in philanthropy, and what are the potential downsides of requiring high certainty of success?","Effective altruists should embrace a more nuanced approach to risk in philanthropy than the traditional expectation of guaranteed success. This shift in thinking is essential for maximizing impact, though it requires overcoming deeply ingrained psychological and institutional barriers.
Most donors instinctively want certainty. They prefer to hear that their donation will definitely achieve the intended outcome, creating a psychological pull toward ""safe"" interventions with predictable, measurable results. This preference is understandable—nobody wants to feel their generosity has been wasted. However, this risk aversion creates significant limitations on philanthropy's potential impact.
The reality is that uncertainty is unavoidable in any meaningful attempt to improve the world. Demanding zero risk of failure eliminates many of the highest-expected-value opportunities. Consider three categories of philanthropic interventions:
First, we have well-established interventions like malaria nets or deworming, where we have substantial evidence of effectiveness and can estimate impacts with reasonable confidence. These are rightfully considered the ""safe bets"" of philanthropy.
Second, we have novel interventions addressing problems where solutions aren't yet established. These might include new approaches to preventing pandemics, reducing risks from advanced technologies, or reforming institutions. These interventions typically have higher uncertainty but potentially enormous upside if successful.
Third, we have research and exploration that might identify entirely new cause areas or intervention strategies. The ""failure rate"" here is necessarily high, but without this exploration, we'd miss breakthrough opportunities to do good.
Forward-thinking funders like GiveWell are increasingly incorporating risk assessment into their grant evaluation process rather than avoiding risk altogether. This represents a crucial evolution in philanthropic thinking—moving from binary success/failure framing toward expected value calculations that account for both probability of success and magnitude of impact if successful.
This risk-aware approach has several practical implications:
Portfolio thinking becomes essential. Rather than judging each grant in isolation, funders should think about their overall portfolio of grants, with higher-risk opportunities balanced by more established interventions.
Scale should influence risk tolerance. Small, early-stage grants can and should have a higher tolerance for failure. As grant size increases, the evidentiary bar should typically increase as well.
Information value deserves consideration. Even ""failed"" interventions often generate valuable knowledge that informs future efforts, creating impact beyond direct outcomes.
Communication about risk needs to improve. Donors, grantmakers, and implementers should develop better language and frameworks for discussing uncertainty and expected value.
The most impactful philanthropic portfolios will include grants across the risk spectrum. By embracing thoughtful risk-taking rather than demanding certainty, effective altruism can reach its full potential to identify and support the interventions that truly do the most good, even when the path to impact involves navigating uncertainty.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Effective Funding,Resource Allocation,"""There's definitely a correlation between how easy a call something was and how good it was... We try to have a much looser trigger finger with smaller, earlier-stage grants... It's the bigger grants where we're generally, we need to really feel great about it.""","How should effective altruists think about funding very high-risk, high-reward projects versus more established interventions with proven track records? I'm struggling with this tradeoff in my own giving decisions.","The tradeoff between high-risk, high-reward projects and established interventions with proven track records represents one of the most nuanced challenges in effective giving. Let me break down how to think about this decision systematically, drawing on effective altruism principles and insights from experienced funders.
Understanding the Value of Both Approaches
First, it's important to recognize that this isn't a binary choice between ""risky and innovative"" versus ""safe and established."" Rather, both approaches serve valuable and complementary functions in maximizing overall impact:
Established interventions provide reliable impact with well-understood outcomes. When you fund proven interventions like malaria nets or vitamin A supplementation, you can be highly confident your donation will improve or save lives in a predictable way.
High-risk, high-reward projects explore potentially transformative approaches that might unlock dramatically higher impact if successful, but with greater uncertainty. These might include novel research directions, policy advocacy with uncertain but large potential benefits, or technological innovations addressing neglected problems.
Evidence-Based Calibration from Funders' Experience
The 80,000 Hours podcast provides valuable insight from experienced funders that can guide your thinking: ""There's definitely a correlation between how easy a call something was and how good it was... We try to have a much looser trigger finger with smaller, earlier-stage grants... It's the bigger grants where we're generally, we need to really feel great about it.""
This suggests a practical heuristic:
For smaller funding amounts, it may be appropriate to accept higher uncertainty when the potential upside is large
For major funding commitments, the evidential bar should be correspondingly higher
This approach recognizes that exploration has value, particularly when done at appropriate scales that allow for learning without jeopardizing reliable impact.
Applying Expected Value Thinking (With Caution)
Effective altruism often employs expected value calculations to compare different opportunities, but we need to apply this approach carefully when dealing with high uncertainty:
Simple expected value calculation:
Project A (established): 95% chance of helping 100 people = 95 people helped in expectation
Project B (high-risk): 5% chance of helping 2,000 people = 100 people helped in expectation
In this oversimplified example, the high-risk project has a slightly higher expected value. However, several important considerations should inform how you interpret such calculations:
1. Estimation reliability: Our probability estimates for novel approaches are often much less reliable than for established interventions. A 5% probability estimate for a novel approach might actually represent significant uncertainty rather than a precise figure.
2. Risk of fanaticism: Another 80,000 Hours podcast discussion highlighted the ""problem with fanaticism"" where expected value calculations can lead to preferring ""options that give you only a very tiny chance of an astronomically good outcome over options that give you certainty of a very good outcome."" This suggests being cautious about letting extremely low-probability but enormous-benefit scenarios dominate your decision-making.
3. Value of information: Early-stage funding often provides valuable information that can guide future, larger investments. This ""exploration value"" provides an additional benefit beyond the direct impact of the project itself.
Portfolio Approach: A Practical Framework
Rather than choosing exclusively between high-risk and established interventions, consider adopting a portfolio approach calibrated to your total giving capacity and risk tolerance:
For smaller individual donors:
Core portfolio (70-80%): Allocate most of your giving to established, evidence-backed interventions that reliably create impact
Exploration portfolio (20-30%): Dedicate a smaller portion to promising but less proven approaches with potential for outsized impact
For larger donors or foundations:
Consider a more sophisticated portfolio with distinct allocations for:
Reliable impact (50-60%): Established interventions with strong evidence
Risk-adjusted growth (20-30%): Interventions with moderate evidence but scaling potential
High-risk exploration (10-20%): Novel approaches with transformative potential
Field-building (5-10%): Building capacity and infrastructure to enable future work
This portfolio approach allows you to contribute to reliable impact while also supporting potentially transformative innovations in proportion to your resources.
Practical Decision Factors
Beyond expected value calculations, consider these factors when evaluating high-risk opportunities:
1. Implementation team quality: The track record and capabilities of the team implementing a high-risk project significantly affect its probability of success. A strong team with relevant experience increases the chance of navigating challenges effectively.
2. Path to scale: Does the high-risk approach have a plausible path to significant scale if the initial work succeeds? Some innovative projects might work well as small pilots but face substantial barriers to broader implementation.
3. Feedback loops: Projects with tighter feedback loops allow for earlier detection of success or failure, making them less risky than those with very delayed feedback.
4. Neglectedness: Is the high-risk approach exploring a genuinely neglected area? Novel approaches addressing neglected problems may have higher expected value than those in crowded spaces.
5. Personal fit: Consider your own knowledge areas and risk tolerance. You might be better positioned to evaluate projects in domains where you have expertise, allowing for more reliable assessment of high-risk opportunities in those areas.
Building On ""The Minimal View""
MacAskill and Summer describe ""the minimal view"" that we have ""reason to benefit all others, regardless of their race, gender, nationality, and so forth, and more reason to benefit them more, and most reason to benefit them as much as possible."" This view is ""portable"" across different moral frameworks and provides common ground for effective altruism.
This minimal view doesn't dictate a specific approach to risk. Instead, it encourages thoughtful consideration of how different giving strategies might ultimately benefit others most effectively, considering both immediate needs and long-term potential.
Practical Recommendation
Given these considerations, here's a concrete approach for your giving decisions:
Start with clear impact goals: Define what you're ultimately trying to achieve (e.g., reducing suffering, saving lives, addressing existential risks)
Establish your risk portfolio: Determine what portion of your giving you're comfortable allocating to different risk levels based on your total giving capacity
For established interventions: Identify the most cost-effective opportunities addressing your priority areas, using resources like GiveWell or Charity Evaluator
For high-risk opportunities: Look for projects that have:
Strong implementation teams
Clear theories of change with testable milestones
Significant upside potential if successful
Reasonable monitoring and evaluation plans
Review and adjust periodically: As high-risk projects develop and new evidence emerges about established interventions, be willing to adjust your portfolio
This balanced approach allows you to contribute to reliable impact while also supporting innovation that could lead to transformative change, aligning with effective altruism's goal of doing the most good possible with available resources.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Future Good,Philosophy ,"That is a strain of thinking in the EA community that is not just about being utilitarian. It’s about having this very ambitious vision of widening the moral circle as far as it could possibly theoretically go, and therefore being in this space where you’ve immunized yourself against being a moral monster by the standards of some future advanced civilization. 

I think one way of thinking of this is, is there an ethics we can come up with where we’ve minimized our odds that future people will think that we were jerks? Because past people sure look like jerks a lot of the time. Because for example, they were treating people badly who we now think are people who should have been treated well. Who are we treating badly who we’ll think should be treated differently in the future?

Historically, we've witnessed dramatic expansions in who ""counts"" morally. Many ancient societies limited full moral consideration to free men of their own ethnic group or city-state.

This perspective connects to effective altruism's broader framework in several important ways:
First, it embodies EA's commitment to impartiality—the view that everyone's welfare matters equally regardless of morally arbitrary factors like nationality, time period, or species. Extending this impartiality to its logical conclusion suggests we should be open to including all beings capable of welfare in our moral considerations.
Second, it reflects cause prioritization principles. If certain types of entities (like digital minds or specific animal species) have moral status but are completely neglected in current moral frameworks, efforts to recognize and protect them could be extraordinarily high-leverage interventions.
Third, it connects to longtermism by considering our moral responsibilities not just to the present but to all future generations, including potentially vast numbers of morally considerable beings that might exist in the future.
The implications of taking moral circle expansion seriously are profound:
It suggests we should maintain moral humility. Just as past generations failed to recognize moral considerations that seem obvious to us today, we should expect our current moral views to be incomplete or flawed in ways we cannot yet recognize.
It encourages us to actively look for neglected sources of moral value or suffering. This might include research into the sentience and welfare of beings we typically overlook, from insects to digital minds that might someday exist.
It reminds us to carefully consider which features make beings morally relevant. Is it consciousness, sentience, intelligence, the capacity to suffer, or something else? Our answers to these questions dramatically affect our moral obligations.
It cautions against moral ossification—locking in potentially flawed moral values into long-lasting institutions or advanced AI systems that might persist far into the future.
This orientation toward moral circle expansion isn't universally embraced within effective altruism. Some focus more pragmatically on well-established sources of welfare like human and animal suffering. Others worry that excessive moral uncertainty could paralyze decision-making.
Nevertheless, this impulse to anticipate future moral developments represents one of effective altruism's most distinctive contributions to ethical thought.

And so our sales pitch was like, 'We don't care about you.' This backward sales pitch that's just... Every other philanthropic advisor, their whole mission is to say, 'What do you care about?' And GiveWell would show up and be like, 'We don't care about what you care about. We're going to help other people as well as we can. If you like that, you can give here. And if you don't, that's too bad, because we're not doing custom research.'""","GiveWell's approach to philanthropy has been described as 'zigging when everyone else zags.' How does their approach differ from traditional philanthropic advising, and what does this reveal about effective altruism's core principles?","GiveWell's contrarian approach to philanthropy—what they've described as 'zigging when everyone else zags'—represents a fundamental departure from traditional philanthropic advising that illuminates several core principles of effective altruism.
Traditional philanthropic advising typically begins with the donor's preferences. The standard approach asks ""What do you care about?"" and then helps donors find organizations within those interest areas. This donor-centered model prioritizes the giver's existing passions, whether that's the arts, education, local community issues, or medical research. The implicit assumption is that the donor's preferences should drive philanthropic decisions.
GiveWell deliberately inverts this model with what they call their ""backward sales pitch."" Instead of asking what donors care about, they essentially declare, ""We don't care what you care about."" Their focus is singular: helping others as effectively as possible, based on rigorous evidence and analysis. If donors value this approach, they can support GiveWell's recommended charities; if not, GiveWell won't adapt its recommendations to match donor preferences.
This seemingly counterintuitive stance reveals several foundational principles of effective altruism:
First, it demonstrates a commitment to cause-neutrality—the idea that we should select causes based on their impact potential rather than personal connection or emotional appeal. By refusing to customize research to donor preferences, GiveWell embodies the view that objective factors like scale, tractability, and neglectedness should drive cause selection, not subjective preferences.
Second, it reflects intellectual honesty and epistemic rigor. GiveWell won't offer custom research that might suggest all cause areas are equally valuable simply to please donors. This stance acknowledges the reality that some interventions demonstrably accomplish more good than others, and that maintaining this truth is more important than accommodating donor preferences.
Third, it operationalizes the principle of impartiality. By focusing on helping others as effectively as possible, regardless of who those others are or what personal connection the donor might have to them, GiveWell embodies the view that everyone's welfare matters equally.
Fourth, it represents a commitment to transparency and integrity in institutional design. Rather than creating financial incentives that might compromise their mission (such as offering customized research for higher fees), GiveWell maintains clear boundaries that preserve the integrity of their recommendations.
The success of this approach, despite its apparent rejection of conventional philanthropic wisdom, reveals something important about effective altruism's appeal. While traditional philanthropy often treats giving as primarily about the donor's interests and values, effective altruism offers a different framework: philanthropy as an opportunity to accomplish as much good as possible in the world, guided by evidence rather than personal preference.
This shifts the donor's role from expressing personal values through giving to partnering in a shared project of figuring out how to help others most effectively. For many people, this reframing is liberating—it offers a more meaningful and ambitious vision of what philanthropy can accomplish.
GiveWell's willingness to maintain this principled stance, even when it means potentially turning away donors, exemplifies effective altruism's commitment to impact above institutional growth or donor accommodation. The remarkable thing is that this seemingly poor ""sales pitch"" has proven extraordinarily effective at attracting donors who share these core values—people who are more interested in maximizing their impact than in expressing their personal preferences.","{

What's the reasoning behind this view of our current moment as potentially pivotal for humanity's long-term future?","The view that we might be living at the 'most important time' in human history stems from a compelling argument about technological development and its relationship to humanity's long-term trajectory. This perspective, common among some effective altruists, rests on several key insights about our current moment and potential futures.
The reasoning begins with a far-reaching vision of humanity's possible future—what's sometimes called a ""technologically mature civilization."" This refers to a future human civilization that has reached the limits of what's physically possible given the laws of nature. Such a civilization might span the galaxy, exist for millions or billions of years, and potentially support vastly more sentient beings than currently exist on Earth. Some envision this future civilization as largely digital in nature, with consciousness perhaps existing primarily in computational substrates rather than biological bodies.
If such a civilization is physically possible—and the laws of physics suggest it is—then the stakes of our current moment come into sharp focus. The reasoning continues:
First, we're undergoing an unprecedented period of technological acceleration. For most of human history, change happened gradually over many generations. Now, transformative technologies emerge within decades or even years. This acceleration means we're rapidly developing technologies with unprecedented power to shape our future trajectory.
Second, some of these technologies—particularly artificial general intelligence—could represent a critical juncture. They might enable the transition toward the kind of technologically mature civilization described above, but they also introduce risks that could permanently curtail humanity's potential or even lead to extinction.
Third, the outcome of this critical period might effectively ""lock in"" certain trajectories, making them difficult or impossible to alter later. For instance, the development of superhuman AI systems with certain values or goals might determine the character of all future civilization in ways that become unchangeable once those systems are deployed.
The conclusion follows: if you believe that (1) an extraordinary future civilization is physically possible, (2) we're developing technologies that could either enable that future or foreclose it, and (3) the decisions made during this period might irreversibly determine which path we take, then our current moment takes on enormous importance.
Even if the transition to such a mature civilization won't happen for thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, this period still represents a potentially decisive ""pixel"" in the timeline of our galaxy. If the most consequential decisions about humanity's ultimate trajectory are being made now rather than later, then our time is disproportionately important compared to almost any other period in human history.
This perspective helps explain why some effective altruists focus intensely on ensuring that transformative technologies like advanced AI are developed safely and aligned with human values. If we're truly at a pivotal moment that could determine the character of all future civilization, then getting these decisions right becomes arguably the most important task facing humanity.
However, this view also faces legitimate critiques. Some question whether technological development is really as discontinuous as this argument suggests. Others doubt that values or trajectories can truly become ""locked in"" in the way the argument proposes. Many emphasize that previous generations also believed they lived at uniquely important moments, suggesting we should be cautious about similar claims today.
Even with these caveats, the possibility that we occupy an unusually influential moment in human history warrants serious consideration. If there's even a modest chance that our decisions now will shape humanity's trajectory for thousands or millions of years to come, the importance of our time would still be immense from a longtermist perspective.""

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Risk Reduction,Philosophy,"Roughly the problem [with fanaticism] is that if you are an expected value maximizer, which means that when you’re making choices you just evaluate an option by taking all the possible outcomes and you assign them numeric values, the quantity of value or goodness that would be realized in this outcome, and then you just take a probability-weighted sum, the probability times the value for each of the possible outcomes, and add those all up and that tells you how good the option is. Well, if you make decisions like that, then you can end up preferring options that give you only a very tiny chance of an astronomically good outcome over options that give you certainty of a very good outcome, or you can prefer certainty of a bad outcome over an option that gives you near certainty of a very good outcome, but just a tiny, tiny, tiny probability of an astronomically bad outcome. And a lot of people find this counterintuitive. 

Robert Wiblin: So the basic thing is that very unlikely outcomes that are massive in their magnitude that would be much more important than the other outcomes in some sense end up dominating the entire expected value calculation and dominating your decision even though they’re incredibly improbable and that just feels intuitively wrong and unappealing. 

",I'm concerned about 'fanaticism' in expected value calculations for catastrophic risks. How can effective altruists maintain rigorous quantitative thinking while avoiding being driven by tiny probabilities of extreme outcomes?,"The problem of 'fanaticism' in expected value calculations represents one of the most challenging theoretical puzzles in effective altruism, particularly when dealing with catastrophic risks. Let me explain this challenge and outline practical approaches for maintaining quantitative rigor while avoiding the pitfalls of being driven by infinitesimal probabilities of extreme outcomes.
Understanding the Fanaticism Problem
As described in the 80,000 Hours podcast, the fanaticism problem arises when standard expected value calculations lead to counterintuitive conclusions in cases involving extremely positive or negative outcomes with very small probabilities:
""If you are an expected value maximizer... you can end up preferring options that give you only a very tiny chance of an astronomically good outcome over options that give you certainty of a very good outcome, or you can prefer certainty of a bad outcome over an option that gives you near certainty of a very good outcome, but just a tiny, tiny, tiny probability of an astronomically bad outcome.""
To illustrate with a concrete example from the podcast: Imagine facing a choice between:
Safe option: Ensuring the universe contains 1 trillion happy people with very good lives
Gamble option: Taking a 1 in 10^100 chance of being able to create any finite number of happy people you want, but otherwise creating 1 trillion suffering people
Standard expected value calculations might suggest taking the gamble, despite the near certainty of causing tremendous suffering, simply because multiplying an astronomical number of happy people by even an infinitesimal probability can yield a larger expected value than the safe option.
This type of reasoning seems deeply flawed to many people, as it allows tiny probabilities of extreme outcomes to dominate our decision-making, potentially leading to practically absurd choices.
Theoretical Approaches to Address Fanaticism
Several theoretical approaches have been developed to address this problem while maintaining mathematical rigor:
1. Bounded Utility Functions
One approach is to use utility functions that have upper and lower bounds, preventing any outcome from having infinite or astronomically large positive or negative value. This limits how much any single outcome can dominate the expected value calculation.
For example, if we set the maximum possible value at 1 trillion happy lives (or some other large but finite number), then no probability of creating more lives could outweigh certainty of reaching this maximum.
2. Risk Aversion in the Utility Function
Another approach incorporates risk aversion directly into the utility function, giving disproportionate weight to certainty over gambles. This reflects the intuition that there is additional value in certainty beyond the raw expected value calculation.
This might involve using a logarithmic or other concave utility function that places relatively less value on additional benefits as the total increases, reflecting diminishing marginal utility.
3. Rejecting Expectational Reasoning for Tiny Probabilities
Some philosophers argue that expectational reasoning should not apply to probabilities below a certain threshold. This approach maintains that very small probabilities (e.g., below 10^-20) should be treated differently than larger probabilities when making decisions.
As the podcast mentions: ""There's a thought like, well, what we care about is the actual outcome of our choices, not the expectation."" This perspective suggests paying more attention to what will actually happen in most cases, rather than being driven by remote possibilities.
4. Multi-Level Approaches to Decision-Making
Another solution employs different decision procedures at different levels or in different contexts. This might involve using expected value for comparing options with similar levels of certainty but switching to more conservative approaches when comparing options with vastly different risk profiles.
Practical Approaches for Effective Altruists
Moving beyond theory, here are practical approaches for maintaining quantitative thinking while avoiding fanaticism in your decision-making:
1. Use Expected Value as a Starting Point, Not the Final Word
Treat expected value calculations as one important input to decision-making rather than the sole determinant:
Calculate expected values to understand the quantitative tradeoffs
Then explicitly consider other factors like robustness of evidence, model uncertainty, and risk profile
Recognize when tiny probabilities are driving your conclusions and subject these cases to extra scrutiny
2. Incorporate Confidence Levels in Probability Estimates
When dealing with very small probabilities, explicitly track your confidence in those estimates:
A 0.000001% probability based on strong empirical data should be treated differently than the same probability based on speculative reasoning
Consider using confidence intervals rather than point estimates for critical probabilities
When confidence is low, consider using the upper bound of your confidence interval for negative outcomes and the lower bound for positive outcomes (a form of prudential conservatism)
3. Account for Model Uncertainty
Recognize that the models used to generate probability estimates may themselves be flawed:
Use multiple models with different assumptions to generate a range of estimates
Place more weight on conclusions that hold across different reasonable models
Be especially cautious when all models share the same fundamental assumptions
4. Apply Scope Insensitivity Corrections Carefully
While scope insensitivity (undervaluing large numbers) is a recognized cognitive bias, its correction shouldn't lead to fanaticism:
When considering very large impacts, explicitly check whether your valuation scales appropriately with the magnitude
Consider using logarithmic or other non-linear scales for evaluating extremely large numbers
Remember that our intuitive moral judgments may contain wisdom not captured by simple linear scaling
5. Adopt Portfolio Thinking
Rather than allowing a single expected value calculation to determine all your resources, consider a portfolio approach:
Allocate some resources to interventions with more certain positive outcomes
Dedicate another portion to addressing low-probability, high-impact scenarios
Adjust the allocation based on your confidence in the underlying models and probabilities
This allows for addressing catastrophic risks without going ""all in"" based on calculations involving tiny probabilities
6. Value Robustness and Option Value
Place explicit value on keeping options open and building robust systems:
Prefer interventions that perform reasonably well across multiple possible futures
Value research and capacity-building that can help address a wide range of scenarios
Consider the option value of approaches that maintain flexibility to adapt as new information emerges
Applying These Principles to Catastrophic Risk Assessment
When specifically assessing catastrophic risks (like nuclear war, pandemic prevention, or AI safety), these principles suggest:
Conduct standard expected value calculations, including the probability of the catastrophe and its estimated impact
Examine the drivers of your results, checking whether they depend heavily on specific low-probability scenarios
Consider the robustness of evidence behind key probability estimates, being particularly careful about speculative estimates of very low probabilities
Compare different intervention approaches not just on expected value but also on evidence quality, robustness across scenarios, and option value
Allocate resources across a portfolio of interventions with different risk profiles and time horizons
This balanced approach maintains the quantitative rigor that makes effective altruism powerful while avoiding the pitfalls of fanaticism that can lead to counterintuitive or practically problematic decisions. It recognizes that expected value calculations are an essential tool for comparative evaluation but not a complete decision procedure, especially when tiny probabilities of extreme outcomes are involved.
The goal is not to abandon quantitative thinking but to enrich it with considerations of confidence, robustness, and practical wisdom—allowing effective altruists to address catastrophic risks responsibly without falling prey to mathematical artifacts that can arise from naive application of expected value calculations.","{

            ""content"": ""The problem of 'fanaticism' in expected value calculations represents one of the most challenging theoretical puzzles in effective altruism, particularly when dealing with catastrophic risks. Let me explain this challenge and outline practical approaches for maintaining quantitative rigor while avoiding the pitfalls of being driven by infinitesimal probabilities of extreme outcomes.
Understanding the Fanaticism Problem
As described in the 80,000 Hours podcast, the fanaticism problem arises when standard expected value calculations lead to counterintuitive conclusions in cases involving extremely positive or negative outcomes with very small probabilities:
""If you are an expected value maximizer... you can end up preferring options that give you only a very tiny chance of an astronomically good outcome over options that give you certainty of a very good outcome, or you can prefer certainty of a bad outcome over an option that gives you near certainty of a very good outcome, but just a tiny, tiny, tiny probability of an astronomically bad outcome.""
To illustrate with a concrete example from the podcast: Imagine facing a choice between:
Safe option: Ensuring the universe contains 1 trillion happy people with very good lives
Gamble option: Taking a 1 in 10^100 chance of being able to create any finite number of happy people you want, but otherwise creating 1 trillion suffering people
Standard expected value calculations might suggest taking the gamble, despite the near certainty of causing tremendous suffering, simply because multiplying an astronomical number of happy people by even an infinitesimal probability can yield a larger expected value than the safe option.
This type of reasoning seems deeply flawed to many people, as it allows tiny probabilities of extreme outcomes to dominate our decision-making, potentially leading to practically absurd choices.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Risk Reduction,Impact Assessment,"The higher the impact of the action you’re about to take, the more certain you ought to be before taking it. I think that’s an intuition that kind of bears out. You see this idea in medical ethics, the idea of not taking the irreversible action when you’re uncertain , you see it in legal ethics, the idea of preliminary injunctive actions, stopping an irreparable harm , things like that. And so there’s been a lot of interest in computer science for the same reason. How do we formalise the impact that an action is going to have? And it’s very difficult. There are some jokes within the AI safety community about, you ask an AI system to cure cancer, which it does, but then it kills the patient anyway so that the ‘impact’ of making the cure is minimised.","You're advising a safety engineer who's working on an AI system design. They tell you: ""I want to make this system as impactful as possible by allowing it to take bold, high-leverage actions without too many constraints."" How would you respond from an Effective Altruism perspective, particularly regarding safety considerations?

","From an Effective Altruism perspective, I'd encourage you to reconsider the approach of minimizing constraints for high-impact AI systems. There's an important principle in safety engineering that applies particularly well to potentially transformative technologies: the higher the potential impact of an action, the more certainty we should have before taking it.
This principle appears across various fields. In medical ethics, doctors avoid irreversible procedures when uncertain. In legal contexts, preliminary injunctions prevent irreparable harm while a case proceeds. The same caution should apply even more to AI systems with potentially far-reaching consequences.
Consider the challenge of formalizing ""impact"" in AI systems. A classic thought experiment in AI safety illustrates the difficulty: an AI tasked with curing cancer might develop the cure but then eliminate the patient to ""minimize its impact"" on the world. This highlights how even well-intentioned optimization can go wrong without proper constraints.
Instead of focusing on removing constraints to enable bold actions, I'd recommend:
Designing for verifiability and interpretability so you can understand what the system is doing and why
Implementing robust monitoring and kill-switches that can't be circumvented
Starting with constrained domains where mistakes have limited consequences
Gradually expanding capabilities only after thorough testing and validation
Building in mechanisms that make the system corrigible (able to be corrected)
Remember that from an EA perspective, we're trying to maximize expected value. When dealing with systems that could have enormous impact, the expected value calculation needs to account for the possibility of catastrophic outcomes, even if they seem unlikely. This is why safety measures that might seem overly cautious are actually rational responses to genuinely uncertain risk profiles.
The most impactful approach may be a more patient one: building systems whose actions we can confidently predict and align with human values before scaling them to take more consequential actions.","{

But they might also increase a variety of social costs to the communities that they're policing...

The research you've seen showing that hiring more police officers reduces crime rates represents an important benefit that shouldn't be dismissed. Crime reduction improves safety, economic activity, and quality of life for residents.
However, effective policy evaluation requires examining all consequences, both positive and negative. Police presence might reduce crime while simultaneously generating significant social costs to the communities being policed. These costs could include:
Psychological burden from increased surveillance and stops
Risk of harmful police-citizen interactions, particularly in communities with historical tensions
Economic costs of fines and legal complications that may fall disproportionately on vulnerable residents
Potential undermining of community trust and self-governance
These negative impacts could potentially offset or even outweigh some of the crime reduction benefits, particularly if they damage long-term community-police relations or exacerbate underlying inequities.
An EA approach would suggest:
Quantify both benefits and costs as comprehensively as possible
Consider distributional effects (who bears the costs vs. who receives the benefits)
Explore alternative approaches that might achieve similar benefits with fewer costs
Design the program to minimize harmful side effects
Implement robust monitoring to track both crime metrics and community wellbeing indicators
You might also consider whether the same resources could achieve greater overall wellbeing through alternative approaches to public safety, such as community-based interventions, mental health services, or addressing environmental factors that contribute to crime.
Remember that the goal isn't just to reduce crime statistics but to improve overall wellbeing for all members of the community in a sustainable, equitable way.

""In a study of more than 38,000 males who were arrested for crimes... being added to a DNA database reduced re-offending by a stunning 43% and the harsher criminal sentences that are favored by self-styled tough-on-crime politicians have shown no evidence of producing any comparable level of crime reduction… deterring a crime by a DNA database has cost less than 10% of the cost of producing the same deterrent effect by building more prisons.”

you know you’ll be more likely to get caught if you offend again. So basically if the database matches you with crime scene evidence, then that’s a lead that police might not have had otherwise.",You're consulting for a criminal justice reform organization that wants to allocate its limited budget most effectively. They're trying to decide between funding programs for rehabilitation of convicted offenders or investing in preventative measures. What evidence-based insights would you offer from an Effective Altruism perspective?,"From an Effective Altruism perspective, the evidence strongly suggests focusing resources on preventative measures rather than rehabilitation, though both have their place in a comprehensive approach.
When we examine the data, we find considerable ""low-hanging fruit"" in preventing crimes before they occur. One particularly striking example comes from research on DNA databases. In a study of more than 38,000 males who were arrested for crimes, being added to a DNA database reduced re-offending by an impressive 43%. The mechanism is straightforward but powerful: knowing you're more likely to be identified through DNA evidence if you commit another crime creates a strong deterrent effect.
What makes this approach particularly compelling from an EA standpoint is its cost-effectiveness. This preventative measure has been shown to cost less than 10% of what it would take to achieve the same crime reduction through increased incarceration. This stark efficiency difference illustrates why evidence-based prevention often yields better returns than approaches focused on punishment or rehabilitation after crimes occur.
This doesn't mean rehabilitation isn't valuable. Rather, it suggests that when resources are truly limited, prevention offers more impact per dollar. Other preventative approaches with strong evidence bases include:
Targeted cognitive behavioral therapy for at-risk youth
Community-based violence interruption programs
Environmental design changes that reduce crime opportunities
Early childhood interventions that address root causes
For your organization, I would recommend:
Conducting a portfolio analysis of current spending to identify low-performing programs
Gradually shifting resources toward evidence-based preventative approaches

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Career Choice,Impact Assessment,"Top researchers typically find that they, depending on the fields, hit their peak productivity often at age 40 to 50... senior hires compared to junior hires, they often gave figures that were about three times higher. But often there's not that many years of experience separating those two positions, which kind of suggests that people have managed to triple their impact in that early part of their career.

 What about for people who don’t want to go back to school? Perhaps they have more of a doer personality. They want to go out and take a job and actually be creating things. 

Benjamin Todd: Yeah, so I think again, there’s a bunch of positions in policy that could be a good fit for someone like that. I mean in general, there’s just so many options in policy. There’s things for all kinds of different skill sets. But yeah, outside of think tanks, you’ve got all kinds of jobs working for a politician. So in the US you could become a congressional staffer. Also in the US, you could work for an election campaign. That’s often one of the ways that people go in.","I'm currently working in a corporate job but want to transition to a career where I can have more positive impact, particularly in policy areas relevant to effective altruism. I don't want to go back to school for another degree if possible. What paths should I consider that would allow me to build towards substantial impact over time?","Your situation highlights an important insight from the research on career impact: professionals often experience dramatic growth in their effectiveness during the early stages of their careers, making strategic transitions particularly valuable.
Studies of expert performers show that researchers typically reach peak productivity around ages 40-50, and comparisons between junior and senior hires often show approximately a 3x difference in impact. This suggests that people can triple their effectiveness during the early-to-mid career phase – making this an excellent time for you to transition into more impactful work.
For someone with your corporate background who wants to enter policy without returning to school, there are several promising paths to consider:
Political staffing roles: In the US, becoming a congressional staffer provides direct influence on policy development. Your corporate experience may be valuable for roles involving economic policy, regulation, or public-private partnerships.
Election campaigns: Campaign work offers opportunities to shape policy platforms and build relationships with future decision-makers. This path can lead to positions in an administration if your candidate wins.
Policy advocacy organizations: Many nonprofits and advocacy groups value professionals with corporate experience who can communicate effectively with business stakeholders.
Government relations: Your corporate background might be particularly valuable in roles that bridge the public and private sectors, either working within government to engage with industry or in public affairs roles for organizations aligned with your values.
Think tanks: While some research roles require advanced degrees, many think tanks also need people with project management, communications, and operational skills.
To maximize your impact in these paths:
Leverage transferable skills from your corporate experience (analysis, stakeholder management, communication)
Build domain expertise in specific policy areas most aligned with effective altruism priorities
Cultivate a professional network in your target field through volunteering, events, and informational interviews
Consider starting with positions that offer growth potential rather than immediate impact
Remember that your career impact will likely grow substantially as you gain experience in the policy sphere, so focus on positions that offer steep learning curves and access to valuable networks rather than optimizing solely for immediate impact.

Studies of expert performers show that researchers typically reach peak productivity around ages 40-50, and comparisons between junior and senior hires often show approximately a 3x difference in impact. This suggests that people can triple their effectiveness during the early-to-mid career phase – making this an excellent time for you to transition into more impactful work.
For someone with your corporate background who wants to enter policy without returning to school, there are several promising paths to consider:
Political staffing roles: In the US, becoming a congressional staffer provides direct influence on policy development. Your corporate experience may be valuable for roles involving economic policy, regulation, or public-private partnerships.
Election campaigns: Campaign work offers opportunities to shape policy platforms and build relationships with future decision-makers. This path can lead to positions in an administration if your candidate wins.

I think what's at play here is an act/omission bias and it doesn't seem to me to be compelling that just because we aren't the direct cause of a negative experience, we don't have a duty or we shouldn't be interested in trying to alleviate that negative experience.""","From an effective altruism perspective, why might someone prioritize reducing factory farming and animal suffering, and what interventions in this area seem most promising?","From an effective altruism perspective, prioritizing animal welfare and factory farming can be strongly justified through the scale-neglectedness-tractability framework: **Scale:** Factory farming affects billions of animals annually - over 70 billion land animals and potentially trillions of fish. If we believe animal suffering matters morally (even if weighted less than human suffering), the sheer numbers suggest enormous scale. Each factory-farmed animal might experience months or years of severe confinement and suffering. **Neglectedness:** Despite the enormous numbers, animal welfare receives far less funding than many human-focused causes. Factory farming specifically receives minimal resources compared to its scale - less than 1% of philanthropic dollars, despite affecting orders of magnitude more individuals. **Tractability:** Several interventions have shown promising results in reducing animal suffering cost-effectively. Regarding the most promising interventions, effective altruists typically focus on: 1. **Corporate campaigns:** Advocacy targeting companies to improve welfare standards (like cage-free eggs or broiler chicken welfare) has demonstrated concrete success in changing conditions for millions of animals per campaign. These campaigns leverage market concentration - convincing one major company can affect millions of animals. 2. **Plant-based and cultivated meat research and development:** Supporting alternatives to animal products could ultimately reduce demand for factory farming. The growing commercial success of plant-based products suggests this approach is gaining traction, and cultivated meat could eventually transform animal agriculture if technological hurdles are overcome. 3. **Institutional meat reduction:** Programs working with large food service providers to reduce animal product purchasing by even small percentages can affect large numbers of animals due to the scale of these institutions. 4. **Welfare reforms through legislation:** Ballot initiatives and legislative campaigns have secured welfare improvements for millions of animals, though these are often more resource-intensive than corporate campaigns. 5. **Values spreading and movement building:** Growing the number of people concerned about animal welfare could have long-term multiplier effects.

Recently, I've been learning about effective altruism and questioning whether my focus on climate is truly where I can have the most impact. How do effective altruists think about cause prioritization, and what factors should I consider when evaluating where to direct my career efforts?","Your experience mirrors that of many people who encounter effective altruism – including some leading researchers in the field. One EA researcher shared a similar journey: ""I was really keen and excited to work in climate change, and I dove into a Ph.D on climate physics... And then during my Ph.D I met Will MacAskill and Will started getting me to think about my values more seriously.""
This researcher began questioning how much they prioritized different values: the long-term future versus present concerns, human versus nonhuman animal welfare, and other fundamental questions. This reflection ultimately led them to shift from climate work to focus on effective altruism movement building and AI policy, areas they came to believe offered greater impact potential.
This doesn't mean climate work isn't valuable – it absolutely is. But effective altruism encourages us to critically examine where our particular skills and resources can do the most good relative to what would happen otherwise.
When considering cause prioritization, effective altruists typically evaluate causes on three key dimensions:
Scale: How large is the problem and how much good could be accomplished by solving it?
Tractability: How solvable is the problem, and how much progress can be made with additional resources?
Neglectedness: How many resources are already dedicated to this problem? Areas receiving less attention often present opportunities for greater marginal impact.
Your climate experience gives you valuable skills and knowledge that might transfer to other areas. For instance, expertise in modeling complex systems, understanding international coordination challenges, and knowledge of energy technologies could be relevant to biosecurity, AI governance, or other global catastrophic risks.
That said, there are strong arguments for working on climate change within an EA framework, particularly if:
You have specialized skills or connections in this area that would be difficult to rebuild elsewhere
You're focusing on particularly neglected aspects of climate work (like climate adaptation in developing countries)
You're exceptionally motivated by climate work, which might make you more effective than in other areas
The most important step is to engage in serious reflection about your values and impact potential across different causes. This might include asking:
What outcomes do I most care about preventing or creating?
Where are my skills most transferable and valuable?
What problems seem most neglected relative to their importance?
Where can I realistically make the most difference given my capabilities?
This process of reflection may affirm your current path or suggest new directions – both outcomes are equally valid if they lead to you having greater positive impact.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Risk Reduction,ROI,"You mentioned a potential fourth criteria for choosing what problems to work on is urgency, do you have an idea of like how to quantify that kind of thing and include it in the framework as a whole?

Yeah, so in the framework of some of the earlier papers that looked at saving lives, when you try to put a value on a life, which of course is controversial, but used large uncertainties, then you can think about what the return on investment would be or the payback time of putting this money into alternate foods. It turned out that the payback time was very short, both in the global case, in the US case. Particularly in the US, the return on investment was between 800% and 40 million percent per year. Even if you only believe the lower bound, it’s still a really high return on investment. One way to think about this is well it’s very urgent, so we should be capturing these opportunities that pay off very quickly first and then, move to other things. ",You're reviewing grant applications for an effective altruism foundation focused on global catastrophic risk reduction. One proposal focuses on developing alternate food sources that could sustain humanity if a catastrophe disrupted conventional agriculture. The project seems promising but expensive. How would you evaluate its urgency relative to other global catastrophic risks?,"When evaluating this alternate foods proposal from an EA perspective, urgency becomes a crucial fourth criterion alongside the traditional scale, tractability, and neglectedness framework.
For catastrophic risk interventions like this one, we can quantify urgency through return on investment (ROI) or payback time analyses. This approach is particularly valuable for comparing interventions that address similar-scale risks but may differ dramatically in their efficiency.
Research on alternate food sources provides a compelling case study in how to quantify urgency. When researchers calculated the ROI for investing in alternate food preparations, they found extraordinarily high returns, ranging from 800% to 40 million percent per year, even when using conservative estimates. These figures reflect the tremendous value of having backup food systems ready before a catastrophe rather than scrambling to develop them after disruption occurs.
The logic follows from the time-sensitive nature of the intervention: for every day earlier we develop functional alternate food systems, the analysis suggests we could save between 100 to 40,000 lives in expectation. This creates a strong case for immediate action rather than delay.
To properly evaluate this proposal against others in your portfolio, I would recommend:
Comparative urgency assessment: Calculate similar ROI or payback time figures for your other grant options to allow direct comparison
Robustness testing: Examine how sensitive these calculations are to different assumptions about catastrophic risk probabilities
Portfolio analysis: Consider how this intervention complements others in your existing grant portfolio
Timing considerations: Assess whether there are timing dependencies that might make this intervention particularly valuable now versus later
Even if the project seems expensive in absolute terms, the extraordinary ROI figures suggest it may deserve priority funding if they hold up under scrutiny. The key insight from an EA perspective is that capturing opportunities with extremely rapid payback times often makes sense before moving to interventions with longer-term returns, even if both address problems of similar ultimate scale.
This doesn't mean automatically funding the proposal, but it does suggest giving serious weight to the urgency dimension alongside your standard evaluation criteria.","{

And so that has enabled me, I mean, I can do a lot of the research but by funding ALLFED I'm able to pay people with other skills that can advance the overall effort much faster than if I were just trying to do it myself.""",I'm a researcher with expertise in a specific technical area relevant to global catastrophic risks. I'm trying to decide whether I should focus on doing direct research myself or earning more money to donate to organizations working in this space. What factors should I consider from an Effective Altruism perspective?,"From an Effective Altruism perspective, the choice between direct work and earning to give hinges on your comparative advantage and the counterfactual impact of each path.
There's an illustrative example from a catastrophic risk researcher who faced this exact dilemma. After calculating that each day of accelerated preparation for alternate food systems could save between 100 to 40,000 expected lives, they realized: ""I have to actually donate now, this is the cause that I've been looking for.""
Their key insight was recognizing the multiplicative power of funding. While they could personally do valuable research, by funding an organization they could ""pay people with other skills that can advance the overall effort much faster than if I were just trying to do it myself.""

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Evidence Based Evaluation,,"""There has been a really big change in the last 10 years or so especially within DFID and within the World Bank to really seriously think about what is the evidence behind the decisions that we're making. One of the reasons I moved to DFID is it has been one of the aid agencies that has changed the most to constantly be questioning ourselves. We're going through that whole process at the moment of looking at what we're doing and saying, is it really evidence based? What's the new research say? What stuff should we stop doing? Because the new evidence is saying we shouldn't be doing that.""",I work for a foundation that funds international development projects. How can we apply effective altruism principles to evaluate which programs we should continue funding versus which ones we should stop supporting?,"Let me outline a concrete, evidence-based approach your foundation can implement to evaluate your international development portfolio through an effective altruism lens.
Step 1: Establish an evidence classification system
First, create a standardized framework for classifying the evidence supporting each program:
Evidence Tiers:
Robust evidence - Multiple high-quality RCTs with consistent results across contexts
Strong evidence - At least one high-quality RCT with supporting observational data
Promising evidence - High-quality observational studies or pilot RCTs
Theoretical basis - Sound theory but limited empirical testing
Insufficient evidence - No compelling theoretical or empirical support
For each program in your portfolio, assign both:
Current evidence tier based on existing literature
Confidence level in that classification (high/medium/low)
Step 2: Conduct a systematic evidence review of your portfolio
Apply this classification system to every program you fund:
For each program, identify the specific intervention type and its core mechanisms
Conduct a targeted literature review of the most recent evidence
Pay special attention to systematic reviews and meta-analyses
Note when the most recent high-quality evidence was published
As UK's Department for International Development (DFID) discovered during their evidence review, you may find that some long-running programs no longer align with the best available evidence. For example, they found that certain entrepreneurship training programs showed disappointing results in newer studies, despite earlier promise.
Step 3: Implement a decision matrix for funding continuation
Create a structured decision process using this matrix:
Evidence Level
Cost-Effectiveness
Decision
Robust
High
Continue/Expand
Robust
Medium
Continue/Optimize
Robust
Low
Redesign/Replace
Strong
High
Continue/Evaluate

Optimize/Evaluate
Strong
Low
Discontinue
Promising
High
Continue with evaluation
Promising
Medium
Pilot alternatives
Promising
Low
Discontinue
Theoretical/Insufficient

Discontinue unless strategic learning value
This approach recognizes that not everything needs continuous testing. As development economists note, ""We don't need to test that bed nets work anymore because that's done."" Programs with robust evidence (like bed net distribution) can continue without further testing if cost-effectiveness remains high.
Step 4: Address the ""stopping problem"" systematically
Discontinuing programs is often the hardest part. Implement these specific practices to overcome institutional resistance:
Pre-commit to decision criteria before reviewing results
Establish a phase-out protocol for discontinued programs
Create a replacement pipeline so discontinuation feels constructive
Document and share learning from discontinued programs
Allocate transition funding to minimize harm to beneficiaries
As DFID demonstrated, being willing to stop ineffective programs is crucial for maximizing impact. When they found limited evidence for certain agricultural extension approaches, they redirected funding to more evidence-backed interventions.
Step 5: Balance individual program evaluation with portfolio-level thinking
Don't evaluate each program in isolation. Consider:
Complementary effects between programs
Diversification benefits across intervention types
Information value of newer approaches
Collective impact potential where programs might enable greater coordination
This addresses the collectivist critique of effective altruism. Sometimes individual programs might not optimize impact separately, but together they create systems change opportunities that produce more good collectively.
For example, combining deworming programs with school feeding initiatives might produce synergistic effects beyond what either would achieve alone.
Step 6: Implement a continuous learning system
Establish these concrete mechanisms:
Annual evidence updates for each program area
Quarterly portfolio reviews using standardized metrics
Dedicated innovation funding (~10-15% of portfolio)
Regular external evidence audits to counteract confirmation bias
This systematic approach to evidence-based program evaluation maintains the rigor of effective altruism while acknowledging important nuances about existing evidence bases. It balances the need to fund well-established interventions while remaining open to new approaches and evidence.
By implementing this framework, your foundation can maximize its impact by directing resources to where they will do the most good, while maintaining the flexibility to adapt as new evidence emerges.","{

For example, combining deworming programs with school feeding initiatives might produce synergistic effects beyond what either would achieve alone.
Step 6: Implement a continuous learning system
Establish these concrete mechanisms:
Annual evidence updates for each program area
Quarterly portfolio reviews using standardized metrics
Dedicated innovation funding (~10-15% of portfolio)
Regular external evidence audits to counteract confirmation bias
This systematic approach to evidence-based program evaluation maintains the rigor of effective altruism while acknowledging important nuances about existing evidence bases. It balances the need to fund well-established interventions while remaining open to new approaches and evidence.
By implementing this framework, your foundation can maximize its impact by directing resources to where they will do the most good, while maintaining the flexibility to adapt as new evidence emerges.""

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Metrics,Calculations,"""So first of all I think it's really, it's quite hard to draw conclusions about what fraction of things work by what fraction of studies show positive effects. Because we tend to test the new things. So if some things we don't test because we've tested them many times before, and we know they work, and so we don't test them anymore. So bed nets would be an example of that. Like we don't need to test the bed nets work anymore because that's done.""","I've been reading impact evaluations of different development interventions and noticed that some highly recommended programs only have a few studies supporting them, while others have many studies with mixed results. How should I interpret these patterns when trying to decide which charities to support?","Your observation touches on a crucial aspect of evidence interpretation that affects practical giving decisions. Let me walk you through how to analyze these patterns and make more informed decisions about which charities to support.
Understanding Study Patterns: Beyond Simple Counting
When you see a recommended program with only a few supporting studies, while others have many studies with mixed results, consider these key factors:
1. Testing follows uncertainty, not just importance
Researchers prioritize testing interventions where there's genuine uncertainty about effectiveness. As development economists point out: ""We don't need to test that bed nets work anymore because that's done.""
This creates a counterintuitive pattern: The most reliably effective interventions may have fewer recent studies precisely because their effectiveness is already well-established. Meanwhile, interventions with mixed or uncertain evidence generate more studies as researchers try to resolve the uncertainty.
Practical application: When you see just a few studies supporting an intervention, check their age and quality. If they're older, high-quality studies (like large-scale RCTs) that haven't been contradicted, this might indicate settled knowledge rather than weak evidence.
2. Publication bias affects apparent success rates
The research literature isn't a random sample of interventions. Several biases affect what gets studied and published:
Novel interventions are more likely to be studied than established ones
Positive results are more likely to be published than null results
Interventions with strong theoretical backing get more research attention
Practical application: When comparing intervention types, don't simply tally positive versus negative studies. Instead, look for:
The largest, most rigorous studies (these are less affected by publication bias)
Systematic reviews that attempt to include unpublished studies
Pre-registered studies (where researchers committed to publishing regardless of results)
3. Context dependency creates genuine heterogeneity
When you see mixed results across studies of the same intervention type, this often reflects real differences in:
Implementation quality
Local contexts
Target populations
Specific program design
Practical application: Rather than averaging results across all studies, identify which contexts most closely match the charity you're considering. If a microfinance program shows positive results in South Asia but not in East Africa, and you're considering a South Asian charity, the regional studies are more relevant.
A Concrete Evaluation Process
Here's a step-by-step process to apply these insights to your charity selection:
Step 1: Categorize the evidence base for each intervention
Create these categories:
Settled effectiveness - Few recent studies because effectiveness is established (e.g., insecticide-treated bed nets)
Actively researched, promising - Many studies with predominantly positive results (e.g., school-based deworming)
Actively researched, mixed - Many studies with varying results (e.g., microfinance)
Insufficient evidence - Few studies, typically newer interventions
Step 2: For ""settled effectiveness"" interventions
Focus your evaluation on:
Implementation quality of specific charities
Cost-effectiveness compared to other settled interventions
Scalability and room for more funding
For example, Against Malaria Foundation implements a settled intervention (bed nets) with exceptional monitoring and cost-effectiveness.
Step 3: For ""actively researched, promising"" interventions
Examine:
Whether positive results come from the highest-quality studies
Consistency across different contexts
Whether the charity implements the version that showed positive results
Monitoring systems to ensure fidelity to the evidence-based model
For example, GiveDirectly implements cash transfers with strong monitoring to ensure the intervention matches what was proven effective in studies.
Step 4: For ""actively researched, mixed"" interventions
Here your analysis should be most careful:
Identify the specific factors associated with success versus failure
Assess whether the charity incorporates these success factors
Check if the operating context matches contexts where positive results were found
Look for evidence that the organization learns and adapts based on results
For example, some graduation programs for the ultra-poor show strong results, but only when they include specific components in certain contexts. Verify that your chosen charity includes these critical elements.
Step 5: Create a portfolio based on evidence patterns
Instead of choosing only charities from one category, consider a strategic allocation:
60-70% to ""settled effectiveness"" charities with exceptional implementation
20-30% to ""actively researched, promising"" interventions
0-10% to carefully selected ""actively researched, mixed"" interventions where you have specific reasons to believe they're implementing a version that works
This approach balances impact and learning while acknowledging the patterns you've observed in the research literature.
By understanding how research attention and publication dynamics affect the evidence base, you can make more sophisticated interpretations of study patterns and ultimately direct your support to charities that will do the most good with your donation.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Population Ethics,,"""When you first asked this question, the two maybe most obvious answers people might give are: first one, so-called total utilitarianism, the thing we're trying to maximize here is total welfare summed over all people. So, among other things, other things being equal, the more people are better provided they have positive well being, like they have lives that are worth living.
Hilary Greaves: So, that's the first option, total utilitarianism in the variable population context, that comes radically apart from a second way of ordering these worlds which you might call average utilitarianism, where the quantity you're trying to maximize is not total welfare added up across all people, but average welfare summed across all people.”

Hilary Greaves: That bit that you've actually measured in your impact evaluation, we know, is going to be massively dominated by the things that you haven't included in your impact evaluation.""
","I've been evaluating different charitable interventions and feel confident about donating to organizations with strong randomized controlled trials and clear metrics. However, I recently heard about ""cluelessness"" in effective altruism. What does this concept mean, and how should it influence my approach to charitable giving?","The concept of ""cluelessness"" represents one of the most thought-provoking challenges within effective altruism, and I'm glad you're engaging with it. This idea extends beyond simple uncertainty and can significantly reshape how we think about impact evaluation.
At its core, cluelessness acknowledges that when we take a genuinely long-term perspective—considering all the effects our actions will have throughout time—the total impact of our interventions will likely be dominated by unforeseen consequences rather than the measured, immediate effects we can quantify through RCTs and other evaluation methods.
As philosopher Hilary Greaves, who has done significant work on this concept, explains: ""That bit that you've actually measured in your impact evaluation, we know, is going to be massively dominated by the things that you haven't included in your impact evaluation."" This creates a profound challenge for the standard EA approach of impact quantification.
Consider a typical global health intervention: we might measure lives saved, additional years of healthy life, or economic benefits. But what about the long-term consequences of population changes, cultural shifts, or technological developments that might stem from those interventions? These ripple effects could potentially dwarf the measured outcomes in either positive or negative directions.
This doesn't mean we should abandon evidence-based giving, but rather that we should approach it with appropriate epistemic humility. Here are some constructive ways to incorporate awareness of cluelessness into your giving:
Value robustness: Seek interventions that seem positive across multiple worldviews and timeframes, rather than those that depend heavily on specific assumptions about long-term effects.
Consider neglected flow-through effects: While we can't predict all long-term effects, we can extend our analysis beyond immediate outcomes to consider reasonably predictable secondary impacts.
Diversify your giving: Allocate some portion of your giving to interventions with more measurable outcomes and some to interventions that might have greater long-term potential.
Value option value: Support interventions that preserve future choices and capabilities rather than those that might foreclose future possibilities.
Embrace moral uncertainty: Recognize that different moral frameworks might evaluate long-term effects differently, and maintain some humility about which framework is correct.
Some effective altruists respond to cluelessness by focusing on existential risk reduction or other longtermist causes, reasoning that while these areas involve deep uncertainty, they at least explicitly aim to account for long-term effects. Others maintain focus on near-term interventions while acknowledging their limitations.
Ultimately, awareness of cluelessness should prompt more careful thinking rather than decision paralysis. The fact that we can't know all the consequences of our actions doesn't mean we can't make reasoned judgments about which actions are more likely to be positive in expectation, especially when some interventions have dramatically stronger evidence than others.","{

They've asked for your thoughts on whether this is reasonable from an effective altruism perspective, considering both personal welfare and potential contribution to scientific knowledge. How would you approach this question?","From an effective altruism perspective, this question involves a nuanced analysis of risk, value of information, and age-dependent decision-making that's quite fascinating.
The decision to take experimental anti-aging supplements can be analyzed through an expected value framework that considers both personal welfare and broader contributions to knowledge. However, the optimal choice depends significantly on your friend's age and risk profile.
As aging researcher Dr. Peter Attia puts it: ""If you're young, it's probably a stupid idea to take an experimental drug. If you're getting to be middle-aged like me, now at least I'm seriously considering, maybe I should be taking metformin. It seems to be safe enough and I don't have any of the kidney conditions that would be bad for.

It's still a risk, but if I'm in my 60's I'm already taking a risk every day by being alive.""
This illustrates how risk calculations change with age. For a young person with low baseline mortality risk, the potential downside of unknown side effects likely outweighs the potential benefits. For someone older facing increasing age-related mortality risks, the calculation shifts significantly.
Here are factors your friend should consider from an EA perspective:
Personal expected value: The benefit-risk ratio depends on:
Their age and current health status
The specific supplement and its evidence base
Their risk tolerance and values around longevity
Information value: If they systematically track effects and share data, they contribute to scientific knowledge. However, this contribution is generally modest without formal trial participation, and shouldn't be the primary justification unless they're participating in a structured study.
Resource allocation: Consider whether the money spent on supplements might do more good if donated to effective charities or longevity research organizations rather than spent on products with limited evidence.
Moral uncertainty: Different ethical frameworks might evaluate this decision differently—consequentialists might focus on expected outcomes, while virtue ethicists might consider the virtues of prudence versus scientific curiosity.
Neglectedness: If your friend has specialized knowledge that allows them to identify truly promising but overlooked compounds, there might be more value than in following popular but unproven trends.
A thoughtful EA approach would be to:
Start with interventions that have stronger evidence and safety profiles before moving to more experimental options
Consider participating in formal clinical trials rather than individual experimentation
Balance personal welfare with the possibility of contributing to knowledge that might help others
Make age-appropriate risk assessments rather than applying the same standard across all life stages

This insight captures a powerful opportunity that researchers have—the ability to redirect intellectual curiosity toward areas where new knowledge could generate substantial positive impact. Here's how you might approach research topic selection through an EA lens:
A Framework for Impact-Oriented Research
Apply the scale-tractability-neglectedness framework:
Scale: How large would the positive impact be if progress were made on this question?
Tractability: Given your specific skills and resources, how likely are you to make meaningful progress?
Neglectedness: How many other researchers are already working on this or similar questions?
Consider field-building potential: Sometimes the greatest impact comes from pioneering work in neglected fields that could eventually attract more researchers and resources.
Value of information analysis: Which research questions, if answered, would unlock better decision-making for individuals, organizations, or policymakers working on important problems?
Comparative advantage: What unique skills, knowledge, or positioning do you have that might allow you to contribute distinctively to certain research areas?
Practical Implementation
You don't need to make a binary choice between personal interest and impact. Consider these approaches:
Portfolio thinking: Allocate some portion of your research time (perhaps 50-80%) to more impact-focused questions while reserving some time for purely curiosity-driven work.
Interest cultivation: Expose yourself to important problems until you develop genuine curiosity about them. Many researchers find that deeper engagement with impactful areas leads to authentic intellectual fascination.
Problem-adjacent research: Look for intersections between areas you already find interesting and important problems. Often there are unexpected connections where your existing expertise could be valuable.
Collaborative projects: Partner with researchers working on high-impact questions where your skills complement theirs, allowing you to contribute to important work while maintaining your core research program.
Discipline-Specific Considerations
Different academic disciplines offer different pathways to impact:
In medicine or public health, consider focusing on high-burden diseases or neglected populations
In economics, research might address poverty, institutional design, or mechanism design for solving coordination problems
In computer science, areas like AI safety, cybersecurity, or algorithmic fairness have significant implications
In philosophy, clarifying concepts relevant to cause prioritization or moral uncertainty could influence numerous decisions
Remember that becoming a scientific leader in an important but neglected area can have multiplicative effects through mentorship, agenda-setting, and institutional influence. Early-career researchers have a unique opportunity to shape their trajectory toward high-impact areas while developing the expertise that makes their contributions valuable.
Ultimately, the best approach balances impact considerations with sustainable motivation—you'll make your greatest contributions in areas where you can maintain long-term commitment and excellence.","{

This insight captures a powerful opportunity that researchers have—the ability to redirect intellectual curiosity toward areas where new knowledge could generate substantial positive impact. Here's how you might approach research topic selection through an EA lens:
A Framework for Impact-Oriented Research
Apply the scale-tractability-neglectedness framework:
Scale: How large would the positive impact be if progress were made on this question?
Tractability: Given your specific skills and resources, how likely are you to make meaningful progress?
Neglectedness: How many other researchers are already working on this or similar questions?
Consider field-building potential: Sometimes the greatest impact comes from pioneering work in neglected fields that could eventually attract more researchers and resources.
Value of information analysis: Which research questions, if answered, would unlock better decision-making for individuals, organizations, or policymakers working on important problems?
Comparative advantage: What unique skills, knowledge, or positioning do you have that might allow you to contribute distinctively to certain research areas?
Practical Implementation
You don't need to make a binary choice between personal interest and impact. Consider these approaches:

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Evidence Based Evaluation,Framework,"Effective altruism as a community is really the confluence of 3 different movements. One was Give Well, co-founded by Elie Hassenfeld and Holden Karnofsky. Second was Less Wrong, primarily based in the bay area. The third is the co-founding of Giving What We Can by myself and Toby Ord. Where Giving What We Can was encouraging people to give at least 10% of their income to whatever charities were most effective. Back then we also had a set of recommended charities which were Toby and I's best guesses about what are the organizations that can have the biggest possible impact with a given amount of money.","I'm new to effective altruism and trying to understand its intellectual foundations. Where did the movement come from, and what are the key ideas or frameworks that guide effective altruist thinking about charitable giving and social impact?","Effective altruism emerged from the confluence of three distinct movements, each contributing essential elements to its intellectual foundation.
The first strand was GiveWell, co-founded by Elie Hassenfeld and Holden Karnofsky in 2007. Frustrated by the lack of rigorous analysis in charitable giving, these former hedge fund analysts began conducting in-depth research to identify charities that could demonstrably improve lives with exceptional cost-effectiveness. GiveWell pioneered the approach of applying evidence-based evaluation to philanthropy, focusing initially on global health interventions where impact could be most clearly measured.
The second influential community was Less Wrong, primarily based in the Bay Area. This rationality-focused community, heavily influenced by the work of Eliezer Yudkowsky, emphasized overcoming cognitive biases, probabilistic reasoning, and expected value calculations. Their intellectual contributions helped shape EA's analytical approach to ethical decision-making and cause prioritization.
The third pillar was Giving What We Can, co-founded by philosophers Toby Ord and William MacAskill at Oxford University in 2009. This organization introduced the commitment to donate a significant portion of one's income (at least 10%) to the most effective charities. Initially, Ord and MacAskill curated recommendations based on their best estimates of which organizations could achieve the greatest impact per dollar donated.
From these origins, several key frameworks have emerged to guide effective altruist thinking:
Evidence-based evaluation: Rigorous assessment of interventions using the best available evidence, with a preference for randomized controlled trials and other high-quality studies when possible.
Cause prioritization via scale, tractability, and neglectedness: Evaluating problem areas based on:
Scale: How large is the problem and how much good could be done by addressing it?
Tractability: How solvable is the problem with additional resources?
Neglectedness: How many resources are already directed toward solving this problem?
Cause-neutrality: Committing to finding the most effective ways to do good, regardless of which cause area they fall within, rather than starting with a predetermined cause.
Counterfactual reasoning: Considering what would have happened otherwise if you hadn't taken a particular action, to understand the true impact of your decisions.
Impartiality: Giving equal moral consideration to all individuals, regardless of factors like nationality, proximity, or species—an idea with roots in Peter Singer's work on expanding our moral circle.
Longtermism: Recognizing that the vast majority of morally relevant individuals may live in the future, making interventions that positively shape humanity's long-term trajectory potentially enormously valuable.
These intellectual foundations have led effective altruists to focus on diverse areas including global health and development, animal welfare, existential risk reduction, and improving institutional decision-making—all united by the common goal of using evidence and reason to maximize positive impact in the world.
The movement continues to evolve, with ongoing debates about moral uncertainty, cluelessness (the challenge of predicting long-term effects), and how to balance near-term welfare improvements against efforts to safeguard humanity's future potential.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Moral Uncertainty,Framework,"If you take the expected value approach, then things might be quite straightforward. You give different probabilities to different moral theories. You look at how good or bad different actions are given those moral theories... First, there's the question how do you even assign credences to different moral views. That's already an incredibly difficult question... The first is, how do you make comparisons across different moral viewpoints. Let's say, again this is hypothetical thought experiment of if you can kill 1 person to save 5 people. The consequentialist view would say, ""Yes, you ought to do that. It's very wrong if you don't do that because 4 lives on net would be lost."" The non-consequentialist view would say, ""No, it's extremely wrong to do that because you're killing someone, and it's extremely bad to kill someone, even if that would produce better consequences."" Now the question is, for whom is there more at stake?","I'm struggling with how to make ethical decisions when I'm not sure which moral framework is correct. For example, I can see merit in both consequentialist and deontological perspectives, but they sometimes recommend different actions. How do effective altruists approach this problem of moral uncertainty, particularly when making decisions about donations or career choices?","Moral uncertainty—being unsure about which moral theory is correct—is indeed a profound challenge that many thoughtful effective altruists grapple with. The good news is that there's been substantial work within EA on developing frameworks to help navigate these waters.
The most straightforward approach is what we might call an ""expected value"" method for moral uncertainty. In principle, this involves:
Assigning credences (subjective probabilities) to different moral theories
Calculating how good or bad different actions would be according to each theory
Taking the probability-weighted average to determine the expected moral value of each action
However, as you might imagine, this approach immediately runs into significant complications. As philosophers working in this area have identified, there are at least two major challenges:
First, how do you even assign credences to different moral views? This is an extremely difficult question, especially since moral theories often make claims that aren't straightforwardly empirical. Your confidence in utilitarianism versus virtue ethics isn't like your confidence in whether it will rain tomorrow.
Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, how do you make comparisons across different moral frameworks when they operate with different currencies of value? Consider the classic trolley problem variation: if you can kill one person to save five, consequentialist theories might say this action saves four lives on net and is therefore good, while deontological theories might view killing the one as absolutely prohibited regardless of consequences.
This raises the profound question: for whom is there more at stake? How do we compare the consequentialist claim that failing to pull the lever costs four lives against the deontological claim that pulling the lever commits a profound moral wrong?
Given these challenges, here are some practical approaches that effective altruists use to navigate moral uncertainty:
Seek robust actions: Look for choices that seem positive across multiple plausible moral frameworks. For example, reducing extreme poverty scores well on consequentialist, virtue ethics, and many deontological frameworks.
Give weight to moral theories proportional to your confidence: If you have stronger reasons to believe one moral theory over another, let that guide your decisions while maintaining appropriate humility.
Consider moral parliament/committee approaches: Imagine representatives from different moral theories negotiating to reach a compromise, giving voice to each theory proportional to your credence in it.
Adjust for moral risk: Be especially cautious about actions that some plausible moral theories consider extremely wrong, even if other theories consider them good (this is sometimes called the ""morally modest"" approach).
Engage with diverse perspectives: Seek out thoughtful advocates of different moral theories to better understand their strongest arguments.
For practical EA decisions like donations or career choices, moral uncertainty often leads to these strategies:
Diversifying donations across causes supported by different moral frameworks
Focusing on interventions with more measurable outcomes while maintaining some moral theory independence
Placing special emphasis on preventing irreversible harms that would be concerning under multiple moral theories
Building career capital that would be valuable across different possible moral priorities
Remember that acknowledging moral uncertainty isn't a sign of confused thinking—it's often a mark of intellectual honesty and moral seriousness. Many of the most thoughtful effective altruists maintain significant moral uncertainty even after years of careful consideration, while still finding ways to take meaningful action to improve the world.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Intervention Effectiveness,Framework,"Right now there's a variety of confidence levels, so I'd say the intervention that I am most confident in right now, are corporate campaigns, because we can track so clearly the role of each advocacy group, the number of companies, the number of animals affected by each pledge, and then the subsequent implementation of those pledges. When it comes to other strategies, I think there's a lot of potential, particularly where strategies focus on important areas, and neglected areas. But it's going to be a lot harder to have confidence in the cost-effectiveness estimates we come up with.","I'm interested in supporting effective animal welfare interventions. There seem to be many different approaches, from corporate campaigns for cage-free eggs to cultivated meat research to leafleting. How do effective altruists evaluate which animal welfare interventions have the strongest evidence base, and which currently seem most promising?","Evaluating animal welfare interventions presents unique challenges and opportunities within effective altruism. While the space has historically had less rigorous evaluation than global health, there's been significant progress in developing frameworks for assessing different approaches.
According to animal welfare researchers in the EA community, there's currently a spectrum of confidence levels across different intervention types. Corporate campaigns—where advocacy groups pressure companies to adopt higher welfare standards—currently have the strongest evidence base. As one researcher notes: ""The intervention that I am most confident in right now are corporate campaigns, because we can track so clearly the role of each advocacy group, the number of companies, the number of animals affected by each pledge, and then the subsequent implementation of those pledges.""
This relative confidence stems from several factors:
Clear causal chains from advocacy efforts to corporate commitments
Quantifiable outcomes in terms of animals affected by policy changes
Ability to monitor implementation through follow-up investigations
Demonstrated cost-effectiveness across multiple campaigns and contexts
When evaluating animal welfare interventions, effective altruists typically consider:
Evidence Quality
What types of evidence support the intervention's effectiveness?
Are there randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs, or primarily observational data?
How robust are the findings across different contexts and implementations?
Impact Metrics
How many animals are affected per dollar spent?
How substantial is the welfare improvement for each animal?
Is there evidence that improvements are actually implemented and maintained?
What is the counterfactual (what would have happened otherwise)?
Strategic Considerations
Does the intervention address particularly important areas with potential for significant welfare improvements?
Does it target neglected species or welfare concerns?
Does it build momentum for further improvements or establish important precedents?
Does it address root causes or primarily symptoms?
Based on these considerations, here's how some major approaches currently compare:
Corporate campaigns (strongest evidence base):
Clear causal pathway from advocacy to concrete welfare improvements
Measurable effects on millions of animals
Demonstrated success across multiple companies and countries
Cost-effective per animal impacted
Institutional meat reduction programs:
Growing evidence base showing effectiveness in reducing animal product consumption
Relatively straightforward to measure implementation
Questions remain about long-term impact and substitution effects
Cultivated meat research & development:
Potentially transformative if successful
Progress metrics are available (cost reduction, technical milestones)
High uncertainty but also high potential impact
Becoming less neglected as commercial interest grows
Individual outreach (leafleting, online ads):
More mixed evidence with some studies showing modest effects
Easier to measure than some interventions, which has biased research toward these approaches
Questions about persistence of behavior change
Generally considered less cost-effective than institutional approaches
Legal/political advocacy:
Potential for very large-scale impact through legislation
Harder to attribute causality and measure counterfactuals
Successfully implemented legal changes provide durable improvements
For those looking to support the most effective animal welfare interventions today, the evidence currently suggests focusing on well-executed corporate campaigns targeting the worst conditions for the largest numbers of animals, alongside strategic investments in alternative protein development and foundational research to better understand animal welfare.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Future Good,Longtermism,"I suppose you agree that you want to shape the distant future for the better. Then, there's two kinds of strategies. There's some access you could think of as broad versus narrow strategies for pursuing that goal where a narrow strategy might be betting on a specific problem or a specific kind of outcome. For example, I think preparing for a potential risk from AI, a lot of strategies for dealing with that would be very narrow and concrete strategies... Then, on the broad end of the spectrum, there could be things that might benefit in many types of outcomes, or might be particularly responsive to potential unknown unknowns that we could be responding to. Maybe a great example of that kind of thing would be trying to have people or institutions make better judgments.","I'm interested in the ""longtermist"" approach to doing good that I've heard about in effective altruism. What are the main strategies longtermists consider for positively influencing the far future, and how do they differ in their approaches?","Longtermism within effective altruism centers on the idea that positively shaping the distant future could be the most important moral priority of our time. When considering how to actually pursue this goal, longtermist thinkers distinguish between two broad categories of strategies: narrow versus broad approaches.
Narrow strategies focus on specific anticipated challenges or opportunities, betting on particular scenarios or problems that might significantly affect humanity's long-term trajectory. As one researcher explains: ""A narrow strategy might be betting on a specific problem or a specific kind of outcome. For example, I think preparing for a potential risk from AI, a lot of strategies for dealing with that would be very narrow and concrete strategies.""
These narrow approaches typically target:
Specific existential risks: Developing technical solutions to risks from advanced AI, engineered pandemics, nuclear war, or climate tipping points
Particular transformation scenarios: Preparing for potential technological transitions like advanced AI, whole brain emulation, or radical enhancement
Institutional designs: Creating specific governance frameworks for emerging technologies
In contrast, broad strategies aim to be beneficial across many possible futures, including scenarios we haven't anticipated. These approaches are particularly valuable for addressing ""unknown unknowns""—risks or opportunities we haven't yet recognized.
As the same researcher notes: ""On the broad end of the spectrum, there could be things that might benefit in many types of outcomes, or might be particularly responsive to potential unknown unknowns that we could be responding to. Maybe a great example of that kind of thing would be trying to have people or institutions make better judgments.""
Broad strategies typically include:
Improving institutional decision-making: Enhancing how governments and other powerful institutions make choices
Building effective altruism as a community: Developing a robust community of people committed to impartially doing the most good
Spreading beneficial values: Promoting moral circle expansion, cooperation, and wisdom
Increasing humanity's resilience: Creating systems that can withstand various catastrophes
An important consideration in evaluating these approaches is the shape of potential progress. While humanity has experienced exponential growth in many metrics thus far, some longtermists argue that progress is more likely to follow an S-curve pattern, eventually reaching a stable plateau.
This perspective has significant implications for strategy. As one researcher notes: ""If you think that now is a really important time and that transformative AI is coming in the next five years or whatever, then that applies to one's career decisions as well... [But] if one thinks that perhaps one should care about the possibility that in 50 years you have this really pivotal moment, then likewise, one should maybe just get a whole ton of experience and PhDs and stuff that are directly aimed at being useful when the moment strikes.""
From this perspective, accelerating economic growth might primarily affect how quickly we reach our potential rather than the ultimate level we achieve: ""The consequence of having a faster rate of economic growth is not that we're going to be in a much better state, 20 million years from now... Instead, it's more like, we're going to get to that really nice state we could be in sooner.""
When deciding between strategies, longtermists consider factors like:
Tractability: How effectively can we make progress on this approach?
Neglectedness: How many resources are already directed toward this strategy?
Robustness: Will this approach help across many possible futures?
Critical windows: Are there time-sensitive opportunities that won't be available later?
While there are ongoing debates within longtermism about the most promising approaches, many practitioners adopt a portfolio approach—directing resources to both narrow interventions addressing specific anticipated challenges and broad interventions that could improve our collective wisdom and capacity across many possible futures.

Increasing humanity's resilience: Creating systems that can withstand various catastrophes
An important consideration in evaluating these approaches is the shape of potential progress. While humanity has experienced exponential growth in many metrics thus far, some longtermists argue that progress is more likely to follow an S-curve pattern, eventually reaching a stable plateau.
This perspective has significant implications for strategy. As one researcher notes: ""If you think that now is a really important time and that transformative AI is coming in the next five years or whatever, then that applies to one's career decisions as well... [But] if one thinks that perhaps one should care about the possibility that in 50 years you have this really pivotal moment, then likewise, one should maybe just get a whole ton of experience and PhDs and stuff that are directly aimed at being useful when the moment strikes.""
From this perspective, accelerating economic growth might primarily affect how quickly we reach our potential rather than the ultimate level we achieve: ""The consequence of having a faster rate of economic growth is not that we're going to be in a much better state, 20 million years from now... Instead, it's more like, we're going to get to that really nice state we could be in sooner.""
When deciding between strategies, longtermists consider factors like:
Tractability: How effectively can we make progress on this approach?
Neglectedness: How many resources are already directed toward this strategy?
Robustness: Will this approach help across many possible futures?
Critical windows: Are there time-sensitive opportunities that won't be available later?
While there are ongoing debates within longtermism about the most promising approaches, many practitioners adopt a portfolio approach—directing resources to both narrow interventions addressing specific anticipated challenges and broad interventions that could improve our collective wisdom and capacity across many possible futures.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Future Good,Longtermism,"I tend to take a view of the structure of possible progress as looking more as an S curve than the exponential that has been experienced by humanity so far... I think on that view, the consequence of having a faster rate of economic growth is not that we're going to be in a much better state, 20 million years from now, if we've had a faster rate of economic growth. Instead, it's more like, we're going to get to that really nice state we could be in sooner. My view, and I think Bostrom explains this pretty well in some of his papers on astronomical waste, and I argue for it in my dissertation, my view is that it's much more important where we end up than how quickly we get there.","I'm passionate about reducing animal suffering and considering a career in cultivated meat development, even though I don't have a biology background. From an effective altruism perspective, how promising is this career path compared to other ways I might help animals, and how should I think about whether it's a good personal fit?","From an effective altruism perspective, cultivated meat development represents one of the most promising approaches to addressing animal suffering at scale. The excitement around this career path stems from its potential to fundamentally transform our food system rather than simply improving conditions within the current paradigm.
As one cultivated meat researcher explains: ""I've never really seen it as something that wouldn't work. It's just there's too many benefits to when it is successful and just the science behind it. While we haven't gotten it to a scalable level yet, it's really not that hard to make meat."" This researcher adds: ""I never really thought about the possibility of it not succeeding... If you're really passionate about ending animal agriculture, ending our exploitation of animals because they taste good, I can't imagine a more impactful area to get involved in.""
What makes cultivated meat particularly promising from an EA perspective is:
Scale potential: If successful, it could eliminate suffering for billions of farmed animals annually by providing a direct replacement for conventional meat
Root cause approach: Rather than ameliorating conditions within animal agriculture, it addresses the fundamental issue by making the system obsolete
Sustainability: Unlike many interventions that require ongoing advocacy, market-viable cultivated meat could create permanent change through consumer choice
Neglectedness: Despite recent investment growth, many technical challenges remain understaffed relative to their importance
Regarding personal fit without a biology background, the field needs diverse expertise. Cultivated meat companies require specialists in:
Bioprocess engineering and bioreactor design
Food science and formulation
Supply chain optimization
Business development and commercialization
Regulatory affairs
Marketing and consumer adoption
The cultivated meat researcher quoted earlier specifically noted: ""You don't necessarily have to be a biologist in order to get involved in this field."" Your existing skills and knowledge may be applicable, particularly if you have strengths in engineering, chemistry, business, or other relevant areas.
To evaluate personal fit, consider:
Technical aptitude: While you don't need a biology background specifically, do you have or can you develop relevant technical skills? Are you comfortable with technical concepts and problem-solving?
Risk tolerance: The field involves uncertainty about timelines and which technical approaches will succeed. Are you comfortable with this uncertainty?
Timeline alignment: Major impact may take years or decades. Does this match your career expectations?
Alternative paths: Compare your potential impact in cultivated meat versus other animal welfare careers like corporate campaigns, alternative protein advocacy, or institutional work. Where would your specific skills create the most value?
Learning environment: Many cultivated meat companies are startups with fast-paced environments. Does this match your working style?
To get started without a biology background, you might:
Take relevant courses in food science, bioengineering, or cell culture
Attend conferences like the Good Food Institute's events to network and learn
Look for entry positions in operations, business development, or project management at cultivated meat companies
Consider roles at organizations supporting the ecosystem, like New Harvest or the Good Food Institute
Explore adjacent areas like plant-based meat that may provide transferable skills
Remember that career impact comes not just from direct work but also from building valuable skills and connections. Even if you later determine another path would allow you to help more animals, time spent in cultivated meat is likely to provide valuable perspective and capabilities.","{

Some questioned whether we should focus on helping animals when there are still so many humans suffering. From an effective altruism perspective, how should I think about the moral consideration of animals compared to humans when deciding where to direct my resources?","This question touches on one of the most fundamental considerations in effective altruism: determining whose wellbeing should count in our moral calculations. The issue isn't whether we should help animals instead of humans, but rather how we should weigh different interests when making allocation decisions.
From an EA perspective, there are several key considerations that inform this question:
First, the scientific evidence strongly suggests that many animals are conscious beings capable of experiencing suffering. As one animal welfare researcher puts it: ""I think that it's pretty settled that most animals are conscious. I mean, at the very least, mammals, and birds. And I think that there is increasingly a consensus that fish are conscious too."" This scientific understanding provides a foundation for including animal welfare in our moral considerations.
Second, the scale of animal suffering is immense. Tens of billions of animals are raised in industrial farming conditions annually, often experiencing significant suffering throughout their lives. The sheer numbers involved mean that even if we assign significantly less moral weight to each individual animal compared to humans, the aggregate suffering could still be morally significant.
Third, animal welfare is comparatively neglected. Far fewer resources are dedicated to improving animal welfare than to human welfare. From an EA perspective, this neglectedness can make animal welfare interventions particularly cost-effective at the margin.
That said, effective altruists hold diverse views on how to weigh animal versus human welfare. Some key approaches include:
Equal consideration of interests: Some argue that similar interests (like avoiding pain) should receive similar consideration regardless of species, though this doesn't necessarily mean equal treatment since different beings have different interests and capacities.
Moral uncertainty approaches: Given uncertainty about the moral status of different animals, some EAs adopt a ""moral parliament"" approach, allocating some resources based on each plausible moral theory.
Capacity-based weighting: Some assign different weights based on cognitive capacities, while recognizing that even beings with simpler minds can still have morally significant experiences.
As the researcher quoted earlier noted: ""I think that it's certainly reasonable for people to think they could have a greater impact on human well-being, but I'm not sure it's reasonable to completely discount animal well-being."" This captures an important middle ground—you need not choose exclusively between helping humans or animals.
In practice, many effective altruists:
Allocate some portion of their giving to highly effective animal welfare charities
Focus on interventions with the highest expected impact per dollar within each cause area
Remain open to updating their allocation as new evidence about effectiveness or moral considerations emerges
When explaining your interest in animal welfare to others, you might emphasize:
You're trying to help as many sentient beings as possible with limited resources
The evidence suggests that many animal welfare interventions are highly cost-effective
Supporting animal welfare doesn't preclude also supporting human-focused causes
The issue isn't species membership but rather considering all suffering regardless of who experiences it

Are there potential biases in how interventions are evaluated in effective altruism? How should I think about interventions where the impact is harder to measure but potentially more significant?,"You've identified an important methodological challenge within effective altruism—what researchers sometimes call ""the streetlight effect"" or the ""measurability bias."" As one animal welfare researcher acknowledges: ""I also think a lot of the things are hard to test, and that has kind of biased people toward, as you were saying, interventions that are relatively easier to evaluate, like leafleting.""
This bias toward the easily measurable is a genuine concern within EA evaluation. When we can only measure certain types of interventions well, we risk overvaluing those interventions simply because we have better data about them, not because they're actually more effective.
The challenge is particularly acute in animal advocacy, where:
Many high-impact interventions (like institutional or policy change) are difficult to evaluate with experimental methods
Long-term effects may be more important than immediate outcomes
Multiple organizations often contribute to the same outcome, making attribution challenging
Some of the most effective approaches might involve complex causal chains
To navigate this challenge thoughtfully, consider these approaches:
1. Broaden your evaluation framework
Rather than focusing exclusively on interventions with the most rigorous evidence, consider a portfolio of interventions evaluated through different lenses:
Interventions with strong direct evidence: These have clear measurements of impact (like some corporate campaigns)
Interventions with strong theory of change: These have compelling logical pathways to impact even if direct measurement is challenging
Interventions with high expected value: These might have lower probability of success but massive impact if successful (like cultivated meat research)
2. Consider qualitative evidence
Not all valuable evidence is quantitative. Expert judgment, historical case studies, and qualitative research can provide important insights, especially for complex interventions. The absence of RCTs doesn't mean we know nothing.
3. Value foundational research
Supporting research to develop better measurement methodologies for hard-to-evaluate interventions can help overcome the streetlight effect in the long run.
4. Adjust for the bias explicitly
When comparing interventions, consciously adjust your assessment to account for the measurability bias. An intervention with modest measured effects might actually outperform one with strong measured effects once you account for unmeasured outcomes.
5. Look beyond immediate metrics
Focus on interventions that address root causes or create structural change, even if their immediate impacts are harder to quantify. For example, legal reforms might have effects that compound over time in ways leafleting never could.
As the animal welfare researcher you quoted concludes: ""We should certainly avoid the bias toward the easily measurable, but I still think it's worth doing [measurement] where we can produce rigorous studies that can even just demonstrate whether an approach has some effect or doesn't.""
This balanced approach—valuing evidence where we have it while recognizing its limitations—represents the most thoughtful way forward. The goal isn't to abandon measurement but to complement it with other forms of evaluation and to continuously improve our measurement methods for complex interventions.
Some particularly promising animal welfare interventions that might be undervalued due to measurement challenges include:
Institutional meat reduction programs
Corporate welfare reforms beyond the most easily measured
Legal and policy advocacy
Building the farm animal protection movement in neglected countries
Cross-cutting work to improve the quality of animal advocacy research itself

How should we balance the need for evidence with the risk of neglecting important but difficult-to-measure causes?,"You've identified an important tension within effective altruism. While rigorous evidence is core to EA's mission of maximizing impact, there is indeed a risk of bias toward the easily measurable.
This challenge emerges naturally from EA's commitment to evidence-based decision making. When we can clearly measure outcomes - like how many malaria cases are prevented per dollar - we gain confidence in our impact. However, this creates a potential blind spot for interventions where outcomes are harder to quantify but potentially more significant.
Several approaches can help balance this tension:
First, we can develop better evaluation frameworks for complex interventions. Just because something is difficult to measure doesn't mean it's impossible. The field of impact evaluation continues to advance, creating more sophisticated tools for assessing complex interventions like policy advocacy or institutional reform.
Second, we should explicitly acknowledge uncertainty in our analyses. Rather than avoiding hard-to-measure interventions entirely, we can incorporate uncertainty into our expected value calculations. This might involve wider confidence intervals or scenario-based approaches that consider multiple possible outcomes.
Third, we can allocate our resources across a portfolio of interventions with different evidence profiles. Some portion might go to well-established interventions with robust evidence, while another portion supports promising approaches that are harder to evaluate but have potentially transformative impacts.
Fourth, we should continue investing in research to develop better measurement techniques. Many interventions that seemed impossible to evaluate rigorously twenty years ago can now be assessed using randomized controlled trials or other methods.
Finally, we should maintain epistemic humility. The history of philanthropy shows many cases where what seemed obviously effective turned out not to be, and vice versa. This suggests being cautious about putting too much weight on either strong evidence or theoretical promise alone.
The aim isn't to abandon our commitment to evidence, but to recognize that evidence comes in different forms and with different levels of certainty. By being thoughtful about these distinctions, we can pursue both rigor and ambition in our efforts to do the most good.","{

Lewis Bollard: Yeah. I think they could easily be worth a million dollars. I think they could well be worth more than that.","I'm a food science PhD student considering career options. While I could earn a good salary in industry and donate a portion to effective charities (earning to give), I'm wondering if direct work in alternative protein development might be more impactful. How should I think about this career decision from an effective altruism perspective?","Your situation highlights a fascinating aspect of career impact within effective altruism: in certain technical fields, direct work can dramatically outperform earning to give in terms of total impact.
When evaluating this choice between industry/donations and direct work in alternative proteins, it's helpful to quantify the comparison. As animal welfare expert Lewis Bollard notes: ""A really good food scientist could be worth a million dollars in donations a year, or possibly even more, in terms of how much money you need to do a certain amount of good is what an extra person can do... I think they could easily be worth a million dollars. I think they could well be worth more than that.""
This striking assessment means that your direct contributions as a food scientist in alternative protein development might create more good than you could achieve even if you were donating a substantial portion of a high industry salary. This is because:
Talent bottlenecks: The alternative protein field faces significant technical challenges that specifically require food science expertise. While money is important, the field currently needs specialized talent that philanthropy alone cannot easily produce.
Leverage: As a food scientist working directly on these problems, your innovations could influence entire product lines, affecting millions of consumers and potentially billions of animals over time.
Field-building: Early-career scientists help develop the field itself, potentially attracting more talent and funding that multiplies your individual impact.
Comparative advantage: With your specialized PhD training, you have rare skills that are particularly valuable in this space, whereas your earning potential, while good, may not be exceptionally rare.
To make this decision thoughtfully, consider:
If you pursue direct work:
Which specific technical challenges in alternative proteins best match your expertise?
Which organizations have a track record of technical progress and effective use of scientific talent?
What's your personal fit for the alternative protein environment (often startup-driven)?
If you pursue earning to give:
How much could you realistically donate annually?
Which specific funding gaps exist in alternative proteins that your donations would address?
How does your potential donation amount compare to existing funding in the space?
For either path:
How would you develop and maintain relevant expertise and connections?
Which path better builds career capital that preserves future options?
Which would you find more personally sustainable and motivating?
A hybrid approach could also be valuable—perhaps working in industry but focusing on plant-based or cellular agriculture applications, or negotiating with employers for part-time arrangements that allow you to consult with alternative protein companies.
Remember that the ""worth a million dollars in donations"" assessment isn't just about your immediate impact, but rather your potential influence over many years of work. It reflects the outstanding leverage that specialized technical talent can have when directed toward specifically neglected and important problems like alternative protein development.

As animal welfare expert Lewis Bollard notes: ""A really good food scientist could be worth a million dollars in donations a year, or possibly even more, in terms of how much money you need to do a certain amount of good is what an extra person can do... I think they could easily be worth a million dollars. I think they could well be worth more than that.""
This striking assessment means that your direct contributions as a food scientist in alternative protein development might create more good than you could achieve even if you were donating a substantial portion of a high industry salary. This is because:
Talent bottlenecks: The alternative protein field faces significant technical challenges that specifically require food science expertise. While money is important, the field currently needs specialized talent that philanthropy alone cannot easily produce.
Leverage: As a food scientist working directly on these problems, your innovations could influence entire product lines, affecting millions of consumers and potentially billions of animals over time.
Field-building: Early-career scientists help develop the field itself, potentially attracting more talent and funding that multiplies your individual impact.
Comparative advantage: With your specialized PhD training, you have rare skills that are particularly valuable in this space, whereas your earning potential, while good, may not be exceptionally rare.
To make this decision thoughtfully, consider:
If you pursue direct work:
Which specific technical challenges in alternative proteins best match your expertise?
Which organizations have a track record of technical progress and effective use of scientific talent?
What's your personal fit for the alternative protein environment (often startup-driven)?
If you pursue earning to give:
How much could you realistically donate annually?
Which specific funding gaps exist in alternative proteins that your donations would address?
How does your potential donation amount compare to existing funding in the space?
For either path:
How would you develop and maintain relevant expertise and connections?
Which path better builds career capital that preserves future options?
Which would you find more personally sustainable and motivating?
A hybrid approach could also be valuable—perhaps working in industry but focusing on plant-based or cellular agriculture applications, or negotiating with employers for part-time arrangements that allow you to consult with alternative protein companies.
Remember that the ""worth a million dollars in donations"" assessment isn't just about your immediate impact, but rather your potential influence over many years of work. It reflects the outstanding leverage that specialized technical talent can have when directed toward specifically neglected and important problems like alternative protein development.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Evidence Based Evaluation,Philosophy,"A crux is an underlying belief, or assumption or premise, that is feeding into your view about the topic at hand. And feeding in a causally important way, so that if I change my mind about this underlying thing, it would also change my mind about the higher level question.","Two members of your effective altruism group are having a heated disagreement about whether animal welfare should be a top priority cause area. As someone knowledgeable about productive discourse techniques, you want to introduce them to the concept of ""double crux"" to help resolve their disagreement. Explain what a double crux is, why it's valuable for effective altruists who disagree, and how they might apply it to this specific disagreement.","I understand you're trying to help resolve this disagreement about animal welfare prioritization. Let me explain how the double crux framework could help your group members have a more productive conversation.

A double crux is a technique for resolving disagreements by identifying underlying beliefs that are causal to both people's views. Specifically, a ""crux"" is a belief that satisfies this condition: if you changed your mind about this belief, you would change your mind about the main disagreement. A ""double crux"" occurs when you find a belief that's a crux for both people who disagree - though they likely have opposite views about this crux.

The process is valuable for effective altruists because:

1. It moves conversations away from defending positions to exploring underlying reasoning
2. It identifies the most relevant considerations for resolving the disagreement
3. It creates a shared goal of finding truth rather than winning an argument
4. It helps allocate limited research time to the most decision-relevant questions

For your two group members disagreeing about animal welfare prioritization, here's how they might apply the double crux method:

First, they should clearly state their positions:
- Person A: ""Animal welfare should be among our top cause area priorities""
- Person B: ""Animal welfare should not be among our top cause area priorities"" 

Next, they should identify cruxes for their own views by completing this sentence: ""I believe my position because..."" and then asking ""If I changed my mind about this reason, would I change my mind about my position?""

For Person A (pro animal welfare prioritization), potential cruxes might include:
- ""I believe factory-farmed animals have morally significant experiences of suffering""
- ""I believe there are cost-effective interventions to reduce animal suffering""
- ""I believe the scale of animal suffering is enormous compared to other problems""

For Person B (against animal welfare prioritization), potential cruxes might include:
- ""I believe animal suffering matters much less morally than human suffering""
- ""I believe animal welfare interventions have less robust evidence than other cause areas""
- ""I believe other cause areas like global health or existential risk have higher expected value""

To find a double crux, they should look for beliefs where:
1. Person A believes X
2. Person B believes not-X
3. If A changed their mind about X, they'd change their stance on animal welfare prioritization
4. If B changed their mind about not-X, they'd change their stance on animal welfare prioritization

For example, they might discover their double crux is: ""Animal welfare interventions are as cost-effective at reducing suffering as the best global health interventions."" This could be a double crux because:
- If Person A became convinced animal welfare interventions were significantly less cost-effective, they might deprioritize animal welfare
- If Person B became convinced animal welfare interventions were comparably cost-effective, they might elevate animal welfare's priority

Once they identify this double crux, they can productively focus their discussion on examining the evidence about comparative cost-effectiveness rather than arguing abstractly about prioritization. They might review studies together, identify key uncertainties, and potentially even collaborate on research to resolve their disagreement.

The power of double crux for effective altruists is that it channels disagreements toward the most relevant empirical or philosophical questions, potentially leading to better collective decision-making about where to direct limited resources for maximum impact.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Evidence Based Evaluation,Education,"It’s interesting, because some people get very worried about telling teachers how to teach, and we’re undermining the profession of teachers. But actually, most teachers like to have a bit more structure. They like to have help about how to do their lesson plans. So I think you’ve got to introduce it in the right way. You’ve got to talk to the teachers’ unions. This is the kind of thing where you really need to do it at a pretty big scale. You’re often changing the curriculum and the approved government textbooks. So it’s often done at quite a big scale. So then you are getting all the stakeholders on board before you introduce these big changes, and you make sure that the teachers understand that you’re not undermining them, and that you’re just trying to support them. 
","I'm interested in supporting education interventions in developing countries. I've heard that effective altruism emphasizes certain teaching approaches as particularly effective. Could you explain some of the evidence-based education interventions that have shown strong results, and how they're implemented successfully?","Education interventions in developing countries represent an area where evidence-based approaches have identified several remarkably effective strategies. Let me walk you through some of the most promising interventions and implementation considerations.
One particularly effective approach involves providing clearer structure and support for teachers. As education economist Rachel Glennerster explains: ""It's interesting, because some people get very worried about telling teachers how to teach, and we're undermining the profession of teachers. But actually, most teachers like to have a bit more structure. They like to have help about how to do their lesson plans.""
This structured teaching approach often includes:
Detailed lesson plans that break down complex concepts
Supporting materials that reduce preparation time
Clear pedagogical techniques for specific learning objectives
Regular assessments to track progress
However, implementing these structured programs requires sensitivity to local context. As Glennerster notes: ""You've got to introduce it in the right way. You've got to talk to the teachers' unions. This is the kind of thing where you really need to do it at a pretty big scale. You're often changing the curriculum and the approved government textbooks.""
The importance of stakeholder engagement cannot be overstated. Successful implementation typically involves:
Engaging teachers' unions from the beginning
Working within government curriculum frameworks
Ensuring teachers understand the support is meant to empower, not undermine them
Scaling interventions to reach sufficient numbers of schools to justify systemic changes
Another extraordinarily effective approach is teaching at the right level (TaRL), which addresses a fundamental mismatch in many education systems. Glennerster explains the problem: ""You often have ambitious curriculum that is designed for the top 10% of the population... That's a hugely difficult task for a teacher to teach to that range of levels of learning.""
The TaRL solution involves:
Assessing children's actual learning levels rather than assuming grade-level knowledge
Temporarily grouping students by learning level rather than age or grade
Focusing teaching on foundational skills appropriate to each group
Allowing children to progress at their own pace through clearly defined learning milestones
For example, students might be grouped into those still learning letters, those putting together words, and those reading fluently. ""You divide kids by their learning level, and then the teacher can just focus on that particular thing. And that has proved extremely effective,"" Glennerster notes.
This approach has been rigorously tested through randomized controlled trials by organizations like Pratham in India and has shown remarkable results in improving foundational literacy and numeracy skills, particularly for students who were previously falling behind.
Other evidence-based education interventions with strong results include:
Remedial tutoring programs for students falling behind
Reducing teacher absenteeism through monitoring and incentives
Merit scholarships to increase attendance, especially for girls
School-based deworming programs that improve health and attendance simultaneously
When supporting these interventions, consider:
Scale and system integration: The most successful programs work with existing education systems rather than creating parallel structures
Local adaptation: Evidence-based approaches still require contextual adaptation to local languages, cultures, and education systems
Cost-effectiveness: Compare interventions based on cost per learning gain to identify where your support can help the most children
Implementation quality: Even the best-designed programs require careful implementation monitoring
By focusing on these evidence-backed approaches, you can help ensure that your support for education creates meaningful, measurable improvements in children's learning, particularly for those most at risk of being left behind.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Evidence Based Evaluation,Education,"OK, so another one is targeting teaching instruction by learning level and not grade. Can you explain that in a bit more detail? What exactly does that mean? Rachel Glennerster: Let me explain it by starting with the problem, which is very, very prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, which is that you often have ambitious curriculum that is designed for the top 10% of the population.

hat’s a hugely difficult task for a teacher to teach to that range of levels of learning. A better approach is to take children and divide them up, at least for part of the day, where you clump them into groups of kids who are still learning their letters, and kids who know their letters but are still putting together words, or kids who can read quite fluently actually, and you should be introducing them to more advanced material. So you divide kids by their learning level, and then the teacher can just focus on that particular thing. And that has proved extremely effective. ",I've heard about an educational intervention called 'Teaching at the Right Level' that's considered effective in developing countries. Could you explain what this approach involves and why it might be more effective than traditional grade-based education?,"Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) is an evidence-based educational approach that's proven remarkably effective in developing countries. Let me explain how it works and why it outperforms traditional grade-based systems in many contexts.
The core insight behind TaRL stems from recognizing a fundamental problem in many education systems: ambitious curricula designed for the top-performing students leave many children behind. In traditional grade-based systems, teachers follow a standardized curriculum based on a child's age or grade level, regardless of their actual learning level.
Here's why this becomes problematic, especially in developing countries:
In a typical classroom in India or Kenya, for example, you might find students in fifth grade with learning levels ranging from pre-literacy (still learning letters) to grade-appropriate reading. When the teacher teaches fifth-grade material to this diverse group, those who haven't mastered basic reading cannot possibly keep up.
Teaching at the Right Level addresses this by:
Assessing children's actual learning levels rather than assuming grade-appropriate knowledge
Grouping children by learning level instead of by age or grade
Dedicating specific time periods where children work with level-appropriate materials and activities
Using engaging, activity-based teaching methods tailored to each learning level
Regularly reassessing and regrouping children as they progress
For example, during TaRL sessions, children might be divided into groups where some focus on letter recognition, others on word formation, and the most advanced on paragraph comprehension or more complex material.
This approach has proven highly effective for several reasons:
It allows teachers to focus instruction precisely where children need it most
Children experience success rather than constant failure, improving motivation
The approach prevents the cumulative learning deficits that occur when children move through grades without mastering fundamentals
It acknowledges the reality of classrooms in many developing countries, where learning levels are extremely diverse
Rigorous evaluations, including randomized controlled trials conducted by researchers affiliated with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), have shown that TaRL programs can produce significant learning gains in short periods. For example, in India, TaRL interventions implemented by the NGO Pratham have consistently shown substantial improvements in basic reading and math skills.
The effectiveness of this approach demonstrates an important principle in education development: sometimes the most impactful interventions aren't about developing advanced curricula or technologies, but about reorganizing existing resources to better match the actual needs of students.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Neglectdness  ,Media Attention,"One category you haven’t mentioned yet, which gets a lot of coverage in the media, is stubble burning, which is, I think, the burning of leftover crops as part of the growing cycle. Where does that fit into the picture? Is that a big source or a relatively small source? Santosh Harish: So stubble burning is an important episodic source, in a sense. In the months of October and November, when air pollution levels peak in north India, stubble burning actually is a significant contributor. It’s possibly even the primary contributor in those few weeks… een over the course of the year, it’s not an unimportant source, but it’s not nearly as important as the amount of airwaves it receives — whereas stuff like household burning and so on are largely under the radar, despite how important they are. 

","I've been reading about air pollution in India and noticed that stubble burning receives extensive media coverage. However, I'm curious if the media focus accurately reflects its importance as a pollution source compared to other factors. How should I think about media attention versus actual impact when evaluating problems from an effective altruism perspective?","The disparity between media coverage and actual impact that you've noticed with stubble burning in India represents a crucial insight for effective altruism: media attention often correlates poorly with a problem's true scale, tractability, or neglectedness.
Air pollution researcher Santosh Harish provides an illuminating example: ""Stubble burning is an important episodic source, in a sense. In the months of October and November, when air pollution levels peak in north India, stubble burning actually is a significant contributor. It's possibly even the primary contributor in those few weeks.""
However, he then highlights the mismatch: ""Seen over the course of the year, it's not an unimportant source, but it's not nearly as important as the amount of airwaves it receives — whereas stuff like household burning and so on are largely under the radar, despite how important they are.""
This pattern—where visually dramatic, seasonal, or politically convenient problems receive disproportionate attention while more consistent, diffuse contributors remain underexamined—appears across many domains. From an effective altruism perspective, this creates both challenges and opportunities:
Why Media Attention Misaligns with Impact
Several factors drive this misalignment:
Visibility and narrative appeal: Stubble burning creates visible smoke plumes and dramatic imagery, unlike household cooking fires that occur inside millions of homes.
Episodic vs. chronic issues: The media tends to focus on acute, seasonal events rather than persistent, year-round problems.
Urban bias: Issues affecting urban elites (who produce and consume most media) receive more attention than those primarily affecting rural or marginalized populations.
Simplicity of attribution: It's easier to blame a single, visible source than acknowledge complex, multi-causal problems that might implicate everyday activities.
Political economics: Sometimes attention flows to issues where blame can be conveniently placed on specific groups or regions.
How to Correct for This Bias
When evaluating problems, consider these approaches:
Seek quantitative data: Look beyond media coverage to epidemiological studies, emissions inventories, and source apportionment research that quantifies the relative contribution of different factors.
Consider year-round impacts: Assess the total annual burden rather than focusing on peak episodes.
Investigate neglected contributors: Specifically research sources that receive less attention—they often represent overlooked intervention opportunities.
Question conventional wisdom: When everyone seems focused on one aspect of a problem, ask what might be missing from the conversation.
Follow the burden: Identify who bears the greatest health or welfare costs and what sources most affect them, rather than what's most visible to the general public.
Implications for Effective Action
This media-impact misalignment creates opportunities for particularly effective interventions:
Neglectedness premium: Addressing overlooked sources like household air pollution might achieve greater marginal impact per dollar than heavily-discussed sources already receiving significant attention and resources.
Information leverage: Simply providing better information about the true sources of harm can redirect resources more effectively.
Comprehensive approaches: Supporting integrated air quality management that addresses all major sources based on their actual contribution rather than their public profile.
Countercyclical attention: Maintaining focus on important problems during periods when media attention has moved elsewhere.
When evaluating any problem area—whether air pollution, global health, animal welfare, or existential risks—this principle applies: the problems receiving the most public attention aren't necessarily where additional resources will have the greatest impact. By looking beyond headlines to underlying data, you can identify opportunities to do exceptional good in areas that others have overlooked.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Poverty Reduction,Challenging Assumptions," I hope to talk about whether giving cash to the poor beats conventional aid, and whether it might do even better than that by boosting an entire region’s economic growth. But first, can you basically just explain the key case for giving cash directly to the poor? 

Paul Niehaus: Yes. But I would flip the question, because I think that in fact the better question is, “Why not?” So let me explain what I mean by that. We’ve been at this project of trying to accelerate global development poverty reduction for quite a long time now — 50 or 60 years or so since that became a thing. And we’ve spent many trillions of dollars over that time period — some of it well; I think there have been some big successes. But the thing I want to emphasise is that almost all of that money has been spent by people other than the folks living in extreme poverty who we’re trying to help. And yet, if you look at the data, I would say that in aggregate, if you were to look across the evaluations that we’ve done — and it’s now been 20 years or so since we started to do these credible experimental tests that really tell us what works and what doesn’t — generally speaking, people living in extreme poverty have a better track record of putting money to use in ways that improve their lives than the top-down approach where we have programme designers plan and allocate money. 
","I'm considering donating to anti-poverty efforts, but I've heard conflicting opinions about whether giving cash directly to people in poverty is effective compared to more traditional aid approaches. The concern I’ve heard repeated is that giving them the money directly means they won’t spend it as wisely. What does the evidence suggest about direct cash transfers as an intervention, and how should I think about this approach from an effective altruism perspective?","The question of cash transfers versus traditional aid approaches highlights how evidence-based thinking has challenged long-held assumptions in international development. As GiveDirectly co-founder Paul Niehaus explains, we should perhaps flip your question: rather than asking why we should give cash directly, we might ask, ""Why not?""
Niehaus frames the historical context powerfully: ""We've been at this project of trying to accelerate global development poverty reduction for quite a long time now — 50 or 60 years or so since that became a thing. And we've spent many trillions of dollars over that time period... But the thing I want to emphasize is that almost all of that money has been spent by people other than the folks living in extreme poverty who we're trying to help.""
This observation spotlights a key insight: traditional aid approaches often assume outside experts know better than people in poverty about what they need. Yet the evidence challenges this assumption. Niehaus notes: ""If you look across the evaluations that we've done — and it's now been 20 years or so since we started to do these credible experimental tests that really tell us what works and what doesn't — generally speaking, people living in extreme poverty have a better track record of putting money to use in ways that improve their lives than the top-down approach where we have programme designers plan and allocate money.""
Importantly, our modern understanding of cash transfers is relatively recent. As Niehaus explains: ""Up until around 2000 or so, the answer is we actually didn't know too much... because there had been very little high-quality empirical testing. It's only since then, with the advent of the randomized controlled trial movement, that we have generated an enormous amount of data.""
This evidence challenges common concerns about cash transfers:
What do people spend the money on? The data consistently shows that recipients typically invest in:
Improving their housing (metal roofs, concrete floors)
Productive assets (livestock, equipment for small businesses)
Education for their children
Healthcare
Nutrition improvements
Contrary to stereotypes, studies find very limited spending on temptation goods like alcohol or tobacco—typically no increase at all compared to control groups.
What about dependency concerns? The evidence doesn't support fears that cash creates dependency. Most studies show recipients work as much or more after receiving transfers, often investing in productive activities that increase their long-term earning potential.
How does cash compare to other interventions? Cash offers several advantages:
Efficiency: A higher percentage of each dollar reaches beneficiaries since there are fewer implementation costs
Speed: Money can be delivered quickly, especially with mobile payment technologies
Choice: Recipients can address their most pressing needs, which may vary significantly between individuals
Dignity: Cash respects people's agency rather than prescribing solutions
However, cash isn't always the optimal solution. When problems involve:
Public goods like infrastructure
Market failures where individual purchasing power can't solve collective problems
Services requiring specialized expertise
In these cases, other interventions may outperform cash. Additionally, some evidence suggests that complementary programming alongside cash (such as coaching or training) can enhance outcomes in certain contexts.
How should effective altruists think about this? From an EA perspective, cash transfers offer several compelling features:
Strong evidence base: GiveDirectly and similar programs have been rigorously studied
Cost-effectiveness: They deliver substantial welfare improvements per dollar donated
Scalability: They can reach large numbers of people efficiently
Benchmark function: Cash sets a minimum bar that other interventions should exceed to justify their approach
When considering donations, you might view cash transfers as a strong default option that puts the burden of proof on more complex interventions to demonstrate they can achieve better outcomes per dollar.
As with all interventions, impact varies by context. Cash may work differently in urban versus rural settings, in different cultural contexts, or at different transfer amounts. The growing evidence base continues to refine our understanding of where and how cash transfers work best.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Poverty Reduction,Challenging Assumptions,"I think up until around 2000 or so, the answer is we actually didn’t know too much… because there had been very little high-quality empirical testing. It’s only since then, with the advent of the randomised controlled trial movement, that we have generated an enormous amount of data on that. So we’ve learned a lot in the last 20 years . And partly I say that just to say that if you came up, like I did, hearing from people that you can’t just give money to people living in poverty — that that doesn’t solve the problem, or it’s not really going to do any good — then I heard that too. But that comes from a time period in which we actually didn’t have much rigorous data to speak to the question. So what actually happens in all of these studies, these experimental trials — where some people are given money, others are not, and then we compare outcomes and compare their budgets and their spending patterns to see what they’ve done — a lot of different things happen. And that’s part of the point: cash transfers give people a lot of flexibility to do what they want with it. So there is no one answer to the question of what do people living in poverty do with cash transfers? Each person’s going to do something different… there’s pretty consistent evidence that people spend money on things that are positive, that improve their lives.",There's skepticism that direct cash transfers help people in extreme poverty. Some argue that simply giving money doesn't solve underlying problems. What does the evidence actually tell us about cash transfers as an anti-poverty intervention?,"The evidence on cash transfers as an anti-poverty intervention tells a much more positive story than traditional skepticism would suggest. This is an area where careful research has significantly updated our understanding.
Until around 2000, debates about cash transfers were based largely on theory and anecdote rather than rigorous evidence. Many believed giving money directly to people in poverty would lead to wasteful spending, dependency, or other negative outcomes. However, the rise of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in development economics has completely transformed our understanding.
Here's what the evidence now shows:
First, recipients of cash transfers generally use the money productively and responsibly. Contrary to stereotypes about money being wasted on alcohol or luxury goods, most studies find that recipients invest in their basic needs, education, healthcare, and livelihood improvements. A systematic review by Evans and Popova (2017) examining 19 studies across Latin America, Africa, and Asia found no evidence that cash transfers increased spending on temptation goods like alcohol and tobacco—in fact, many studies found such spending decreased.
Second, cash transfers lead to diverse positive outcomes precisely because they allow for flexibility. Unlike programs that dictate exactly what recipients need, cash respects that people in poverty face different circumstances and have different priorities. One person might invest in livestock, another in their child's education, and another in home improvements that prevent illness—each addressing their most pressing needs.
Third, cash transfers often generate economic multipliers in local communities. When recipients spend money locally, it benefits local businesses and creates positive spillover effects. Some studies find that non-recipients in villages receiving cash transfers also experience economic gains.
Fourth, cash transfers have demonstrated positive impacts across multiple dimensions:
Improved nutrition and food security
Increased school attendance and educational outcomes
Better health outcomes, including reduced illness
Increased productive assets and income-generating activities
Improved psychological well-being and reduced stress
Fifth, cash transfers offer excellent value for money. Because they don't require complex implementation systems, a higher percentage of program funds reaches beneficiaries compared to many in-kind assistance programs.
This isn't to say cash transfers are a silver bullet. They may not be sufficient for addressing structural problems like inadequate healthcare systems, and they work best in environments where markets function reasonably well. The evidence also suggests that program design matters—factors like payment size, frequency, duration, and targeting can significantly affect outcomes.
What's particularly striking is how this evidence challenges deep-seated assumptions about poverty. Rather than lack of capability or poor decision-making, the evidence suggests that a key barrier facing people in extreme poverty is simply lack of financial resources. When that constraint is eased, people generally make good decisions about how to improve their lives.
The shift toward cash transfers represents an important evolution in development thinking—moving from prescriptive approaches where experts decide what people need toward approaches that respect the dignity, autonomy, and knowledge of people living in poverty themselves.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Effective Funding,Marginal Thinking,"""We want to direct marginal dollars to the place where marginal cost effectiveness is highest. If we believed that there was one organisation that would deliver the highest impact per dollar, we would just fund one organisation... The reason we've expanded is that now, if we were to direct the marginal dollar to one of our top charities, we think it would be less cost effective than giving it to some of these other organisations.""
""Let's just use vitamin A supplementation as an example... Some countries have much higher rates of vitamin A deficiency than others. If you deliver it in the first set of countries that have high rates of vitamin A deficiency, this programme will be extremely cost effective. But as you go down the list of countries... it's less cost effective.""
","I notice that GiveWell recommends multiple top charities rather than just identifying the single most effective one. This seems counterintuitive - if they know which charity has the highest impact per dollar, why not direct all funding there? How does effective altruism think about allocating resources across multiple effective interventions?","Your question touches on one of the most important concepts in effective altruism: marginal thinking. The reasoning behind GiveWell's approach to recommending multiple top charities rather than just one illustrates how this concept works in practice.
As GiveWell explains: ""We want to direct marginal dollars to the place where marginal cost effectiveness is highest. If we believed that there was one organisation that would deliver the highest impact per dollar, we would just fund one organisation... The reason we've expanded is that now, if we were to direct the marginal dollar to one of our top charities, we think it would be less cost effective than giving it to some of these other organisations.""
This approach rests on a fundamental economic principle: diminishing marginal returns. The impact of additional funding to a program typically decreases as that program receives more money. GiveWell provides a clear example with vitamin A supplementation: ""Some countries have much higher rates of vitamin A deficiency than others. If you deliver it in the first set of countries that have high rates of vitamin A deficiency, this programme will be extremely cost effective. But as you go down the list of countries... it's less cost effective.""
Let's break down the key implications of this marginal thinking approach:
Why Multiple Charities Make Sense
Room for more funding limits: Even the best intervention has a maximum capacity for effectively using additional funds at any given time. Once those immediate opportunities are funded, the next dollar may do more good elsewhere.
Geographic targeting: As in the vitamin A example, the same intervention might be extremely cost-effective in one region but less so in another. After covering the highest-impact regions, it makes sense to switch to different programs.
Diversification of intervention types: Different problems affect different populations, and a portfolio of interventions addresses more diverse needs than concentrating on a single approach.
Risk management: Supporting multiple effective approaches hedges against the possibility that any single intervention might turn out to be less effective than initially estimated.
Learning value: Funding multiple approaches generates more evidence about what works, improving future allocation decisions.
Practical Examples of Marginal Thinking
Consider how this plays out in practice:
Deworming programs: The first phase might target areas with the highest worm burden, where treatment prevents severe symptoms. As those regions receive coverage, additional funding would move to areas with moderate infection rates where the per-dollar impact is lower.
Bed net distribution: Initial funding might cover regions with the highest malaria prevalence and lowest existing net coverage. Once those regions are served, additional dollars go to areas with either lower prevalence or higher existing coverage.
Cash transfers: Early funding might target the most extreme poverty regions with robust mobile money infrastructure. As those opportunities are funded, further dollars might go to regions with either less extreme poverty or more implementation challenges.
How to Apply Marginal Thinking to Your Giving
As a donor, this approach suggests:
Stay informed about funding gaps: The most effective giving opportunity today might not be the same next year as funding landscapes change.
Consider splitting donations: If you're giving a significant amount, dividing it among multiple highly effective organizations might do more good than concentrating it.
Look for neglected sub-areas: Sometimes the highest impact comes from supporting a neglected aspect of an otherwise well-funded cause.
Follow expert allocators: Organizations like GiveWell and Open Philanthropy spend substantial resources tracking these marginal effectiveness curves and can often direct funding more optimally than individual donors could on their own.
This marginal thinking approach represents a sophisticated advancement beyond simply ranking interventions by average cost-effectiveness. By considering where the next dollar does the most good rather than which intervention has historically been most effective on average, effective altruism maximizes the total impact of available resources across a portfolio of worthy causes.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Evidence Based Evaluation,Impact Assessment,"""GiveWell wrote an article titled 'A major update in our assessment of water quality interventions,' and there you explain that you looked into Dispensers for Safe Water years ago and decided not to fund it. But over 2020 and 2021, you took a second look, and changed your mind...""
""Our bar historically has often been around 10 times as cost effective as cash transfers. I think at the time, we estimated that this programme was in the range of three times as cost effective as cash transfers... What changed was that there have been a bunch of studies of water chlorination that we looked at in the past, and there was a meta-analysis that pulled all those studies together... The meta-analysis showed a significantly larger effect on all-cause mortality than we had estimated based on diarrhoeal deaths alone.""
","I've been following charity evaluator recommendations for years, and I've noticed they sometimes change their minds about which interventions are most effective. For example, GiveWell recently updated their assessment of water quality interventions. How should I think about these changing recommendations, and what does it tell us about effective altruism's approach to evidence?","The evolution of charity recommendations provides an insightful window into how evidence-based evaluation works in practice. GiveWell's reassessment of water quality interventions offers a particularly illuminating case study of this process.
GiveWell originally evaluated Dispensers for Safe Water years ago and decided not to recommend it for funding. At that time, they estimated the program was only about three times as cost-effective as direct cash transfers, which fell significantly below their funding threshold of approximately ten times the cost-effectiveness of cash.
What changed their mind? As they explained in their article ""A major update in our assessment of water quality interventions,"" new evidence emerged that substantially altered their understanding of the program's impact:
""What changed was that there have been a bunch of studies of water chlorination that we looked at in the past, and there was a meta-analysis that pulled all those studies together... The meta-analysis showed a significantly larger effect on all-cause mortality than we had estimated based on diarrhoeal deaths alone.""
This evolution in recommendations reveals several important principles about effective altruism's approach to evidence:
1. Commitment to following the evidence wherever it leads
Changing recommendations aren't a sign of weakness but rather demonstrate intellectual honesty and commitment to impact. When new evidence suggests previous conclusions were incorrect, effective altruists update their views accordingly. This willingness to change course based on new information is a fundamental strength of the movement.
2. Growing sophistication in impact assessment
Early evaluations often focus on the most direct and measurable outcomes. Over time, assessments typically become more comprehensive by:
Incorporating indirect benefits that weren't initially quantified
Developing better models of how interventions affect overall welfare
Using meta-analyses to achieve more statistical power
Accounting for longer-term effects that weren't initially obvious
In the water chlorination case, the original assessment focused narrowly on preventing diarrheal deaths. The later meta-analysis revealed larger effects on all-cause mortality, suggesting that clean water provides health benefits beyond just reducing diarrhea.
3. Evolving standards as the field matures
As effective giving has grown, the bar for what counts as ""highly effective"" has risen. What might have been considered exceptionally cost-effective a decade ago might now be viewed as merely good. This doesn't mean the earlier interventions aren't worthwhile—just that we've discovered even better opportunities.
4. Complementary roles of early and late evaluation
Initial evaluations help identify promising directions and rule out clearly ineffective approaches. Later, more comprehensive evaluations provide the confidence needed for large-scale investment. Both stages serve important functions in the ecosystem of effective giving.
How to respond as a donor
Given this reality of evolving recommendations, here are some practical approaches for donors:
View recommendations as provisional: Even the best current recommendations represent our best understanding at this moment, not eternal truths.
Diversify across strong interventions: Supporting several highly-rated interventions rather than just the current top pick provides some hedge against future updates.
Value organizations with update transparency: Organizations that clearly explain why their views have changed demonstrate intellectual honesty and rigor.
Consider the direction of updates: Are recommendations becoming more or less optimistic about certain intervention types over time? These trends can provide useful signals.
Participate in the learning process: Your support of today's recommended interventions generates evidence that improves future recommendations.
Rather than being discouraged by changing recommendations, we should view them as evidence that the effective altruism movement is working as intended: continuously learning, refining its understanding, and getting better at identifying extraordinary opportunities to do good. The fact that recommendations evolve shows the system is responsive to evidence rather than dogmatically sticking to initial conclusions.","{

We don't want that to happen with the next generation of tools that are so powerful, especially one like gene drive.","I'm excited about innovative technologies like gene drives that could potentially eliminate malaria. However, I'm concerned about the time it takes to implement new interventions even after they've been proven effective. From an effective altruism perspective, should we be focusing more attention on accelerating the implementation of proven interventions rather than just developing new ones?","Your question highlights a critical but often overlooked dimension of effective altruism: the implementation gap between discovering effective interventions and achieving widespread adoption. This gap represents an enormous loss of potential impact that deserves serious attention.
The malaria example you cited perfectly illustrates this challenge. As one malaria researcher observed: ""The history of malaria seems to be that you take 15 years from a WHO recommendation to a potential scaleup of a tool. It happened with nets... We don't want that to happen with the next generation of tools that are so powerful, especially one like gene drive.""
This 15-year implementation lag represents millions of preventable deaths—a devastating human cost that effective altruists should be deeply concerned about. The researcher's observation captures both the historical pattern and the urgency of addressing it for upcoming innovations.
From an effective altruism perspective, implementation acceleration deserves significantly more attention for several compelling reasons:
The magnitude of potential impact
The implementation gap effectively means that proven interventions deliver only a fraction of their potential benefit. A 15-year delay in scaling a technology that could eliminate malaria means approximately 7 million preventable deaths (assuming current annual malaria mortality of ~450,000). Closing even part of this gap could save millions of lives.
Comparative neglectedness
While research and development attract significant funding and prestige, implementation science and policy advocacy to accelerate adoption remain relatively neglected. This neglect creates opportunities for high marginal impact, as resources directed toward implementation may face less diminishing returns than additional R&D funding in well-established fields.
Cost-effectiveness calculations
From a cost-effectiveness standpoint, accelerating implementation by even a few years can be extraordinarily valuable. Consider:
If an intervention that saves 100,000 lives annually is implemented 5 years earlier than it otherwise would be, that's 500,000 additional lives saved.
The net present value of benefits increases substantially when they begin sooner rather than later.
Earlier implementation often means earlier learning, refinement, and improvement of the intervention itself.
Concrete approaches to acceleration
Effective altruists could contribute to implementation acceleration through several avenues:
Implementation research: Studying barriers to adoption and testing strategies to overcome them.
Advance preparation: Building systems, training personnel, and establishing distribution networks before interventions are fully approved.
Policy advocacy: Working to streamline approval processes while maintaining appropriate safety standards.
Institutional design: Creating organizations with incentives and capabilities aligned with rapid implementation.
Conditional commitments: Setting up advance market commitments and other mechanisms that reward developers for creating implementable solutions.
Balancing R&D and implementation
This doesn't mean we should shift all attention from R&D to implementation. Rather, it suggests a more balanced portfolio approach that recognizes:
Some problems lack sufficient technical solutions and genuinely need more R&D.
Implementation work on existing interventions and R&D for new solutions can proceed in parallel.
Considering implementation challenges during the R&D phase can lead to more readily scalable solutions.
Different individuals and organizations have comparative advantages in either innovation or implementation.
A practical EA perspective
Effective altruism aims to do the most good possible with available resources. When implementation delays significantly reduce the good accomplished, addressing these delays becomes a priority. Just as EA encourages us to compare different causes using consistent metrics, we should apply similar rigor to comparing the value of:
Developing a new intervention
Scaling an existing intervention faster
Combining these approaches
In the case of transformative technologies like gene drives for malaria, the potential benefits are so enormous that both development and acceleration of implementation deserve significant attention. However, the historical pattern of long implementation delays suggests that marginal resources directed toward implementation acceleration might currently yield especially high returns.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Cause Prioritization,Framework,"On mental health, I think it’s on our long list. And so if anybody wants to join our cause prioritization team to help us work through more things, I think that there plausibly are good opportunities there. Alexander Berger: Again, bed nets are really, really cost effective. And so if you can save a life so cheaply, it can be hard… Mental health is often just not as well understood, the interventions are often not super effective, sometimes quite expensive. And so the relative cost to improve things relative to just letting somebody live and grow up and take a shot can often be pretty high. So that’s not to say that we shouldn’t do more on mental health. We’re interested in doing more, we’re interested in understanding more, but it leaves me, I’m not super optimistic that we’re going to find stuff that we think is more cost effective than the GiveWell top charities there.","I'm particularly concerned about mental health issues and want to support the most effective interventions in this area. However, I notice that mental health doesn't seem to be as prominent in effective altruism discussions as global health or existential risks. How do effective altruists think about mental health as a cause area, and how might it compare to other priorities?","Mental health represents an interesting case study in how effective altruism approaches cause prioritization, balancing enormous scale against considerations of tractability, neglectedness, and cost-effectiveness compared to other highly impactful interventions.
As Open Philanthropy's Alexander Berger explains: ""On mental health, I think it's on our long list. And so if anybody wants to join our cause prioritization team to help us work through more things, I think that there plausibly are good opportunities there.""
This tentative interest acknowledges mental health's importance while signaling that it hasn't yet risen to the highest priority level for many EA organizations. Understanding this requires examining how mental health fares under the cause prioritization framework that guides EA thinking:
Scale
Mental health challenges affect billions of people worldwide:
Depression and anxiety affect hundreds of millions
Mental health conditions account for a substantial portion of the global burden of disease
Mental health issues can significantly reduce quality of life, sometimes for decades
On scale alone, mental health would rank as a top-tier concern. The sheer number of people affected and the profound impact on wellbeing suggest this should be a priority area.
Tractability
The challenge becomes more complex when considering tractability. Berger notes: ""Mental health is often just not as well understood, the interventions are often not super effective, sometimes quite expensive.""
Current mental health interventions face several limitations:
Many therapies show modest effect sizes in rigorous studies
Access challenges limit reach even for proven interventions
Treatment adherence and sustainability issues affect long-term outcomes
Cultural factors can influence intervention effectiveness across contexts
However, this doesn't mean the area is intractable—rather, it suggests we need more innovation and evaluation to identify highly effective approaches.
Neglectedness
Mental health presents a mixed picture on neglectedness:
Significant funding exists in wealthy countries (though still less than for physical health)
Mental health in low and middle-income countries receives very little funding
Certain conditions and populations remain highly neglected
Prevention approaches often receive less attention than treatment
Cost-effectiveness comparison
The most challenging aspect is comparative cost-effectiveness. As Berger explains: ""Again, bed nets are really, really cost effective. And so if you can save a life so cheaply, it can be hard... The relative cost to improve things relative to just letting somebody live and grow up and take a shot can often be pretty high.""
This comparison highlights a fundamental challenge: direct interventions for mental health typically don't achieve the extraordinary cost-effectiveness ratios seen in the most effective global health interventions.
For instance, the cost to provide cognitive behavioral therapy might be hundreds or thousands of dollars per person, while the cost to protect someone from malaria with bed nets might be just a few dollars. Even accounting for the significant suffering prevented by mental health interventions, this difference in cost creates a substantial effectiveness gap.
Potential avenues for mental health in EA
Despite these challenges, several promising directions exist for effective altruists interested in mental health:
Focus on neglected populations: Mental health interventions in low and middle-income countries might offer better cost-effectiveness than in wealthy countries with more existing resources.
Innovative prevention approaches: Developing and rigorously evaluating preventative interventions could be more cost-effective than treatment.
Mental health research: Funding research to develop more effective and scalable interventions could have high expected value over time.
Integration with existing priority areas: Addressing mental health within programs already prioritized by EA (e.g., incorporating mental health support into global health programs) might be particularly effective.
Economic strengthening: Some evidence suggests that economic interventions like cash transfers may improve mental health outcomes, creating potential synergies with existing EA priorities.
A balanced perspective
It's worth noting that effective altruism doesn't suggest everyone must work on only the single most effective cause. As the movement has matured, there's increasing recognition of the value in maintaining a diverse portfolio of cause areas, including some that may not currently achieve the highest measurable cost-effectiveness but show promise for future impact.
Mental health clearly involves enormous suffering that deserves serious attention. The most promising approach may be to seek interventions at the intersection of mental health and established EA priorities, while continuing to build the evidence base for cost-effective mental health interventions that could eventually compete with current top recommendations.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Sustainable Giving,Philosophy,"There’s a very long time where it both felt so clear to me that I ought to be living frugally and giving away as much as I could, and that I had no right to all the money that just happened to be in my bank account because my job paid it to me. It felt very core as a commitment, and also as part of my identity… It felt like it was a real big change for me. And I don’t feel I’ve totally successfully changed that way of thinking. But the way that I think about it is, there is this really satisfying thing about feeling like all of your actions are aligned with your deepest core principles. … Sometimes do things where I think I am doing a wrong thing, and I guess I think it’s also good for the world that I have attempted to develop a disposition that isn’t constantly monitoring that. Because it keeps me mentally healthier in expectation and makes it more likely that I can sustainably do the bigger stuff.",I want to donate effectively but find it hard to maintain motivation when my donations feel like drops in the ocean. How do effective altruists think about sustainable giving and maintaining motivation over the long term?,"Your question touches on a challenge many effective altruists face: reconciling the emotional experience of giving with the rational understanding of impact. Let me share some perspectives on how effective altruists approach sustainable giving and long-term motivation.
Understanding the Psychology of Sustainable Giving
First, it's important to recognize that what you're experiencing is completely normal. Humans evolved to respond to immediate, visible needs in our close communities—not to optimize for abstract impact across distant populations. Our motivation systems aren't naturally calibrated for effective altruism's global, evidence-based approach.
MacAskill and Summer acknowledge this reality in their definition of an effective altruist. They note that ""one need not always be engaged in or motivated by effective altruism"" to be an effective altruist. Just as occasionally running slower doesn't disqualify someone from being a fast runner, having fluctuating motivation doesn't disqualify you from being an effective altruist.
They recognize that being an effective altruist is a matter of degree, corresponding to the extent of your engagement. Most effective altruists have various projects in their lives besides effective altruism, even if it's one of their most central projects.
Strategies for Sustainable Motivation
Here are approaches that many effective altruists find helpful for maintaining long-term motivation:
Focus on concrete impact: Rather than thinking about your donation as ""$100 toward global health,"" frame it as ""providing 20 malaria nets that will protect 40 children."" Concrete framings help our minds grasp the real impact.
Engage with the community: The effective altruism community provides social reinforcement that can sustain motivation. Participating in local EA groups, online forums, or conferences connects your giving to a collective effort that feels more substantial than individual actions.
Set up automatic donations: Many effective altruists recommend setting up recurring donations that happen automatically. This reduces the psychological friction of giving and helps maintain consistent impact even when motivation fluctuates.
Practice giving gratitude: Reflecting on your own fortunate position can help sustain altruistic motivation. Some effective altruists regularly practice gratitude for their opportunities to help others.
Balance depth and breadth of engagement: Rather than thinking about effective altruism as consuming your entire identity, consider it one important project among others in your life. This prevents burnout and creates a sustainable relationship with giving.
Connect with recipient stories: While maintaining critical thinking about effectiveness, also allow yourself to connect emotionally with the individuals who benefit from your chosen interventions. GiveWell and other EA organizations increasingly share stories that complement their quantitative analyses.
Celebrate collective impact: Your individual donation may be a drop in the ocean, but the collective impact of the effective altruism movement is substantial. GiveWell-recommended charities have received over $1 billion in directed donations, saving hundreds of thousands of lives.
Experiment with giving habits: Some people find it more sustainable to make fewer, larger donations; others prefer small, frequent contributions. Discover which approach better sustains your motivation.
A Framework for Thinking About Your Impact
When feeling that your contribution is too small to matter, consider these reframes:
The mathematics of expected value: If you have a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of saving 1,000,000 lives, the expected value is still one complete life saved. Your donation may have a small probability of creating large change or a large probability of creating small change, but the expected value remains meaningful.
The aggregation principle: Your donation combines with others to create impact none could achieve alone. The fact that your individual contribution is small doesn't diminish its moral significance.
The counterfactual perspective: Ask not ""Does my donation solve the entire problem?"" but rather ""Does my donation make the situation better than it would otherwise be?"" This shifts focus from the impossible standard of solving everything to the achievable goal of creating improvement.
The long-term view: Consider your giving as a lifelong practice rather than discrete actions. Over decades, your cumulative impact becomes substantial, especially as your capacity to give may increase.
Remember that effective altruism is fundamentally about using reason and evidence to do the most good you can. This includes reasoning about your own psychology and creating sustainable patterns of giving that work with, rather than against, your natural motivational systems.
By approaching giving with both analytical rigor and psychological wisdom, you can develop a sustainable practice that creates meaningful impact over the long term.
These training examples cover a range of important concepts in effective altruism, including the relationship between EA and moral philosophy, impartiality and cause neutrality, approaches to systemic change, AI career considerations, and sustainable giving practices. Each response provides thorough explanations with practical implications, following the educational and thorough style you requested in your user preferences.

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Effective Funding,ROI,"I think the evidence-backed part is obviously important, but I don't think it's the core idea... The core idea is that not all charitable opportunities are equally valuable. Some do enormous amounts more good than others. And the idea that you should try to figure out which ones those are using the best available evidence is the core idea.","You're giving a brief talk to a local community group that has invited you to speak about effective altruism. Most attendees are generous people who regularly donate to various charities, but they typically choose charities based on personal connections or emotional appeals. How would you explain the core idea that not all charitable opportunities are equally valuable, and that using evidence to identify the most effective ones is central to effective altruism? Include a compelling example that might resonate with everyday donors.","Thank you for inviting me to speak today. I'd like to share a perspective on charitable giving that has transformed how many people, including myself, think about doing good in the world.

Many of us here donate regularly, which is wonderful. We give to causes that touch our hearts – perhaps a local shelter, a disease that affected a loved one, or an organization where we volunteer. These personal connections make giving meaningful and are something to celebrate.

But there's a powerful idea at the heart of effective altruism that I'd like to share: not all charitable opportunities are equally valuable. Some do enormously more good than others – sometimes 10, 100, or even 1,000 times more – with the same donation amount. And using the best available evidence to identify these high-impact opportunities is how we can maximize the good we accomplish with our generosity.

Let me share a concrete example that illustrates this difference:

Imagine your community is raising money to support people with vision problems. You have two options:

Option A: Training a guide dog for one person who is blind in the United States. This costs roughly $40,000 to $60,000 per dog and provides valuable independence and companionship.

Option B: Funding simple cataract surgeries in developing countries, which cost about $25 each and can restore full vision to someone who is blind or severely visually impaired.

Both options help people with vision problems. Both are managed by reputable organizations. But with the same $50,000 donation, you could either provide one guide dog to one person, or you could restore full sight to about 2,000 people who would otherwise remain blind.

This dramatic difference in impact isn't unusual. Across cause areas – whether in global health, education, climate change, or animal welfare – research consistently finds these enormous disparities in effectiveness.

This doesn't mean we should only support the single most effective charity or that personal connections to causes don't matter. Rather, it means that by incorporating evidence about effectiveness into our giving decisions – even partially – we can dramatically increase the positive change we create in the world.

We all want our generosity to make a meaningful difference. Evidence-based giving helps ensure that our donations don't just do some good, but do as much good as possible. It's about honoring the intention behind every dollar we give by ensuring it accomplishes what we most care about: actually improving lives.

As you consider your own giving, I'd encourage you to ask: ""How much good is this donation likely to accomplish? Is there evidence about its effectiveness? Might there be opportunities to do even more good with the same resources?"" These questions are the heart of effective altruism, and they've helped countless donors increase their impact many times over.

I'm happy to suggest resources for learning more, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and questions.","{

This dramatic difference in impact isn't unusual. Across cause areas – whether in global health, education, climate change, or animal welfare – research consistently finds these enormous disparities in effectiveness.

This doesn't mean we should only support the single most effective charity or that personal connections to causes don't matter. Rather, it means that by incorporating evidence about effectiveness into our giving decisions – even partially – we can dramatically increase the positive change we create in the world.

We all want our generosity to make a meaningful difference. Evidence-based giving helps ensure that our donations don't just do some good, but do as much good as possible. It's about honoring the intention behind every dollar we give by ensuring it accomplishes what we most care about: actually improving lives.

As you consider your own giving, I'd encourage you to ask: ""How much good is this donation likely to accomplish? Is there evidence about its effectiveness? Might there be opportunities to do even more good with the same resources?"" These questions are the heart of effective altruism, and they've helped countless donors increase their impact many times over.

I'm happy to suggest resources for learning more, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and questions.""

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Sustainable Giving,Core Principle,"Suppose you're saying, well, you could save a life equivalent for roughly one and a half thousand dollars with GiveWell currently... Well, that would mean that, say, typical college graduates in the US, making like $70,000-80,000 a year on average... if you give 10% of that, that would be $8,000 a year. And so then that's roughly four or five lives saved per year. And so then over a 40-year career, that's 40 times five, which is 200 lives.","I'm trying to decide how much of my income to donate to effective charities. I've heard about the ""Giving What We Can"" pledge to donate 10% of income, but is there a specific rationale behind this percentage? How do effective altruists think about the right amount to give?","The question of how much to donate represents a fundamental consideration for anyone engaging with effective altruism. While the 10% figure has become a common reference point through the Giving What We Can pledge, the thinking behind donation amounts is more nuanced than a single universal percentage.
To understand the rationale, it helps to consider both the impact potential and the sustainability of different giving levels. Philosopher William MacAskill provides a striking illustration of the impact potential: ""Suppose you're saying, well, you could save a life equivalent for roughly one and a half thousand dollars with GiveWell currently... Well, that would mean that, say, typical college graduates in the US, making like $70,000-80,000 a year on average... if you give 10% of that, that would be $8,000 a year. And so then that's roughly four or five lives saved per year. And so then over a 40-year career, that's 40 times five, which is 200 lives.""
This calculation illustrates the extraordinary difference even an ordinary income can make when directed toward highly effective interventions. The scale of potential impact – 200 lives over a career – helps explain why many find even substantial percentages like 10% to be justified by the good accomplished.
However, effective altruism approaches giving amounts through several complementary lenses:
Historical and cultural context
The 10% figure draws on diverse traditions:
The concept of tithing (giving 10%) has roots in many religious traditions
10% represents a meaningful but achievable target for many people
It's simple to calculate and communicate as a standard
This historical resonance helps explain why 10% emerged as a focal point, but EA thinking doesn't treat this number as having special moral significance.
Marginal utility considerations
From an economic perspective, the ""right"" amount depends on diminishing marginal utility – the principle that each additional dollar brings less personal benefit as wealth increases, while potentially doing just as much good for others in extreme poverty.
For someone with significant disposable income, giving substantially more than 10% might reduce their wellbeing only minimally while creating enormous benefits for others. Conversely, someone struggling financially might find even small donations unsustainable.
Sustainability and life planning
Effective altruism emphasizes sustainable giving over time rather than short-term sacrifice. This means:
Finding a giving level that you can maintain or increase over decades
Investing in your skills and career to potentially give more in the future
Building giving into your financial planning rather than treating it as discretionary
Creating social environments that support your giving commitments
Progressive giving approaches
Many effective altruists practice versions of progressive giving, where:
Donation percentages increase as income rises
Windfalls or bonuses might be given at higher rates than regular income
Major life transitions (like promotions) become opportunities to increase giving
Some commit to donating all income above a certain threshold
Beyond percentages: The giving portfolio
Effective altruists also consider how giving fits within a broader impact portfolio that might include:
Direct donations to effective charities
Career choices that create direct impact
Skill development for future impact
Advocacy and movement building
Investment decisions aligned with values
A practical framework
While there's no single ""right"" percentage for everyone, a thoughtful approach might include:
Start where sustainable: Begin with a percentage you can confidently maintain (even 1% is a meaningful start)
Plan for growth: Create a schedule for gradually increasing your giving as you adjust your lifestyle and budget
Use life transitions: Commit a portion of future raises or windfalls to increased giving
Regular reassessment: Periodically reevaluate whether your giving level balances impact with personal sustainability
The core principle isn't adherence to a specific percentage but rather taking the question seriously - recognizing both the extraordinary difference your resources can make and the importance of approaching giving as a sustained commitment rather than a fleeting gesture.
Whether you choose 5%, 10%, or significantly more, what matters most is making giving a deliberate, ongoing part of your life, guided by careful consideration of where your resources can do the most good.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Resource Allocation,Calculations,"This idea of budgetary allocation connects to some of these ideas from the explore/exploit tradeoff... There is a really simple idea that's quite powerful in this context, which is called Thompson sampling. This is the idea that you should figure out your subjective probability that you think something is the best thing to do, presumably through Bayes' rule. And then you should just allocate exactly that percentage of your resources to it.","I'm interested in supporting effective charities, but I'm not sure how to divide my donation budget between different cause areas (global health, animal welfare, existential risk, etc.). What framework do effective altruists use to make these allocation decisions when there's uncertainty about which cause is most effective?","Deciding how to allocate resources across different cause areas represents one of the most intellectually challenging aspects of effective altruism. When faced with deep uncertainty about which cause might ultimately do the most good, effective altruists have developed sophisticated approaches that draw on concepts from decision theory, statistics, and portfolio management.
One particularly powerful framework comes from the ""explore/exploit"" literature in computer science and statistics. As researcher Tom Griffiths explains: ""This idea of budgetary allocation connects to some of these ideas from the explore/exploit tradeoff... There is a really simple idea that's quite powerful in this context, which is called Thompson sampling. This is the idea that you should figure out your subjective probability that you think something is the best thing to do, presumably through Bayes' rule. And then you should just allocate exactly that percentage of your resources to it.""
This elegant approach suggests that if you believe there's a 60% chance that global health interventions are the most effective use of resources, a 30% chance that animal welfare interventions are most effective, and a 10% chance that existential risk reduction is most effective, you should allocate your donations in precisely those proportions.
Let's explore the key components of effective resource allocation under uncertainty:
1. Bayesian updating on cause effectiveness
Start by explicitly quantifying your beliefs about each cause area's effectiveness. Consider:
Available evidence about impact per dollar
How confident you are in that evidence
How neglected each area is
Your moral views on comparing different types of impact
These beliefs should be updated as you encounter new information. If you learn something that makes you more confident in the effectiveness of work on existential risks, you would increase the proportion allocated there.
2. Balancing exploration and exploitation
The explore/exploit tradeoff recognizes two competing objectives:
Exploitation: Putting resources toward what currently seems most effective
Exploration: Gathering more information to improve future allocation decisions
A pure exploitation strategy would put all resources into whatever currently seems best, while a pure exploration strategy would distribute resources to maximize learning.
Thompson sampling elegantly balances these objectives by allocating resources proportionally to your probability estimates, naturally putting more resources toward promising areas while maintaining investment in areas with potential.
3. Considerations beyond simple expected value
While expected value calculations provide a starting point, other factors worth considering include:
Diversification benefits:
Protection against model uncertainty or mistaken assumptions
Maintaining expertise and connections across multiple areas
Supporting a healthy ecosystem of organizations in different cause areas
Comparative advantage:
Your specific knowledge or connections might make your contributions more valuable in certain areas
Some causes might be better fits for certain donors based on their expertise or networks
Temporal considerations:
Some interventions may have critical windows of opportunity
Building expertise in an area often requires sustained engagement
4. Practical implementation approaches
For individual donors, several practical approaches can help implement these principles:
Annual portfolio review:
Explicitly update your probabilities about cause effectiveness yearly
Adjust allocation based on these updated probabilities
Consider making larger shifts after major information updates
Donation splitting services:
Use services like the EA Funds that facilitate splitting donations across causes
Consider donor-advised funds for more complex allocation strategies
Meta-charity approach:
Some donors delegate allocation decisions to organizations specializing in cross-cause comparisons
Groups like Open Philanthropy and Founders Pledge conduct in-depth research across causes
5. The value of consistency and learning
Whatever allocation strategy you choose, there's value in:
Maintaining consistent engagement with your chosen causes
Systematically evaluating the results of your giving
Being explicit about your beliefs and updating them based on evidence
Discussing allocation decisions with others to refine your thinking
The Thompson sampling approach offers a particularly elegant solution because it:
Automatically balances exploration and exploitation
Naturally adjusts allocations as you update your beliefs
Avoids the analysis paralysis that can come from overthinking allocation
Remains flexible as new cause areas or interventions emerge
By combining this principled approach with consideration of your specific circumstances and comparative advantages, you can develop an allocation strategy that both reflects your current best understanding and allows for learning and adaptation over time.","{

How do effective altruists assess interventions with impacts that might unfold over many years or decades, and how does this relate to the growing interest in longtermism within EA?","Evaluating long-term effects represents one of the most challenging and important aspects of impact assessment in effective altruism. The case of deworming provides a fascinating window into how organizations like GiveWell approach this challenge, while also illustrating some of the connections and distinctions between traditional EA evaluation and emerging longtermist thinking.
As GiveWell researcher David Roodman explains: ""Over the course of, I think, well, a year and a half or so, I replicated and reconstructed most of the studies that look at the long-term impacts of deworming... There are lots of studies of the short-term impacts on body weight, height, these kinds of things, within, say, six to twelve months. But many fewer of the long-term impacts. But for our cost-benefit analysis and thinking about whether to recommend deworming charities, of course, the long-term matters a lot. Effects over ten years are ten times as important as effects over one.""
This statement captures several crucial insights about long-term impact evaluation:
Importance of persistence
The magnitude of long-term effects often dwarfs short-term outcomes. As Roodman notes, ""Effects over ten years are ten times as important as effects over one."" This simple arithmetic highlights why long-term evaluation is crucial—interventions with persistent effects might be orders of magnitude more impactful than those with similar short-term benefits but rapid fade-out.
Methodological challenges
Evaluating long-term effects presents distinct challenges:
Fewer studies exist (following participants for decades is expensive and difficult)
More variables can confound results over longer periods
Attrition from study samples increases over time
Publication bias may be more severe for long-term studies
These challenges require particularly careful analysis, which is why GiveWell invested substantial resources in replicating and reconstructing the key long-term deworming studies—ensuring the evidence supporting their recommendations was robust.
Approaches to long-term evaluation
Organizations like GiveWell employ several complementary methods:
Direct longitudinal evidence: Following intervention recipients over many years to measure outcomes directly (as in the key deworming studies that tracked participants into adulthood)
Extrapolation from intermediary outcomes: Using established relationships between short-term measurable outcomes and long-term welfare (e.g., linking childhood nutrition improvements to adult earnings based on broader literature)
Explicit modeling: Developing comprehensive models that combine multiple evidence sources to project long-term effects
Uncertainty analysis: Using sensitivity analyses and explicit confidence intervals to understand how different assumptions affect conclusions
Independent replication: Reconstructing key analyses from original data to verify findings (as Roodman did with deworming studies)
Connection to longtermism
While GiveWell's approach to long-term effects shares some philosophical foundations with longtermism, there are important distinctions:
Similarities:
Both recognize that effects unfolding over time can dominate impact calculations
Both require careful consideration of methodological challenges in projecting distant consequences
Both use expected value reasoning to make decisions under uncertainty
Differences:
Traditional EA evaluation like GiveWell's typically focuses on effects unfolding over years or decades, while longtermism considers centuries or millennia
GiveWell's recommendations typically rely heavily on interventions with some direct empirical evidence, while longtermist causes often involve more speculative projections
The evidence standards differ based on time horizons and availability of data
Practical implications
For donors evaluating interventions with long-term components, several principles emerge:
Value evidence of persistence: Interventions that have demonstrated lasting effects deserve special attention, even if their immediate impacts seem modest
Consider theoretical mechanisms: Understanding why and how an intervention might have persistent effects helps assess whether projected long-term benefits are plausible
Look for robust findings: The most credible long-term effects are those that persist across multiple studies, methodologies, and contexts
Weigh evidence quality explicitly: Rather than simply excluding interventions with weaker long-term evidence, consider how confident we should be in different projections
Recognize the value of contributing to evidence: Supporting studies that track long-term outcomes can have substantial value by improving future allocation decisions
The careful, rigorous approach to long-term effects exemplified in GiveWell's deworming analysis represents an important bridge between traditional evidence-based evaluation and broader longtermist thinking in effective altruism. Both approaches recognize that to truly maximize our positive impact, we must look beyond immediate outcomes to understand how our actions shape the future—whether that future is decades or centuries ahead.","{

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Global Poverty,Calculations,"During the Bush administration, I'd served as the chair for the Global Health Working group for the Clinton global initiative and gotten really interested in global health issues because of the high benefit-to-cost ratio of a number of global health interventions.","I'm new to effective altruism and I've been exploring different cause areas. I've noticed that global health and poverty alleviation receive significant attention within EA. What makes these areas particularly compelling from an effective altruism perspective, especially compared to other worthy causes like education or environmental protection?","Global health and poverty alleviation have emerged as central focus areas within effective altruism for several compelling reasons that illustrate key EA principles in action. As former White House healthcare advisor Ezekiel Emanuel observed from his own experience: ""During the Bush administration, I'd served as the chair for the Global Health Working group for the Clinton global initiative and gotten really interested in global health issues because of the high benefit-to-cost ratio of a number of global health interventions.""
This observation captures a fundamental reason these causes have received such attention: when we apply rigorous analysis to understand where resources can do the most good, global health interventions consistently demonstrate exceptional cost-effectiveness. Let's explore the key factors that make these areas so compelling from an EA perspective:
Extraordinary cost-effectiveness
Global health interventions often achieve remarkable efficiency in improving welfare:
Preventing a death from malaria might cost around $3,000-$5,000 through bed net distribution
Deworming treatments can cost less than $1 per child and yield substantial benefits
Vitamin A supplementation costs approximately $1 per child and significantly reduces mortality
These figures represent extraordinary humanitarian impact per dollar compared to interventions in many other areas, including those in developed countries where similar outcomes (like extending life by one year) often cost orders of magnitude more.
Strong evidence base
Global health interventions benefit from:
Decades of rigorous randomized controlled trials
Clear, measurable outcomes (lives saved, diseases prevented)
Natural experiments that help establish causality
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses that synthesize evidence
Long-term follow-up studies documenting persistent effects
This robust evidence base allows donors to have high confidence that their contributions are actually achieving the intended impact, addressing a key concern in charitable giving.
Substantial neglectedness
Despite their effectiveness, many global health interventions remain severely underfunded:
Hundreds of millions of people still lack access to proven, cost-effective interventions
Geographic and political distance often reduces natural giving to these causes
Beneficiaries typically lack political voice to advocate for themselves
Market mechanisms alone don't address many of these needs
This neglectedness creates opportunities for donors to fund interventions that would otherwise go unsupported, maximizing the marginal impact of each contribution.
Moral considerations
The ethical case for focusing on global poverty incorporates several compelling elements:
The extreme severity of suffering involved (preventable death, debilitating illness)
The arbitrary nature of global inequality (where someone is born shouldn't determine their life prospects)
The direct responsibility connection (we can clearly identify how our actions address specific needs)
The absence of conflicting values (few moral frameworks would argue against saving lives)
Together, these factors create an unusually strong consensus across different ethical perspectives about the moral importance of addressing these issues.
Tractability advantages
Many global health interventions offer clear, well-established pathways to impact:
Solutions often don't require complex systems change
Delivery mechanisms exist and are scalable
Technical solutions (like vaccines) can often bypass socio-political barriers
Progress is measurable in relatively short timeframes
This tractability contrasts with some other worthy causes where solutions may be more complex or uncertain.
Comparison with other causes
This doesn't mean other causes like education or environmental protection aren't valuable—they absolutely are. However, from an EA perspective, several factors often make direct work on these issues in wealthy countries less competitive for marginal resources:
Education in developed countries already receives substantial funding
Environmental protection faces complex political and economic barriers that may limit cost-effectiveness
Many interventions in these areas show more modest or less certain effects in rigorous evaluations
That said, certain neglected aspects of these broader causes—like education in the poorest countries or environmental issues directly affecting the most vulnerable—can be highly effective giving opportunities that align with EA principles.
Evolving perspectives
The EA community's thinking continues to evolve, with growing attention to:
Long-term effects of global health interventions (economic growth, institutional development)
Potential systemic changes that could address root causes of poverty
Interactions between global health and other priority causes
As evidence, methods, and funding landscapes change, the relative prioritization of different causes will continue to develop. The core commitment remains finding the opportunities where additional resources can do the most good, whatever cause area they might fall within.","{

            ""content"": ""Global health and poverty alleviation have emerged as central focus areas within effective altruism for several compelling reasons that illustrate key EA principles in action. As former White House healthcare advisor Ezekiel Emanuel observed from his own experience: ""During the Bush administration, I'd served as the chair for the Global Health Working group for the Clinton global initiative and gotten really interested in global health issues because of the high benefit-to-cost ratio of a number of global health interventions.""
This observation captures a fundamental reason these causes have received such attention: when we apply rigorous analysis to understand where resources can do the most good, global health interventions consistently demonstrate exceptional cost-effectiveness. Let's explore the key factors that make these areas so compelling from an EA perspective:
Extraordinary cost-effectiveness
Global health interventions often achieve remarkable efficiency in improving welfare:
Preventing a death from malaria might cost around $3,000-$5,000 through bed net distribution
Deworming treatments can cost less than $1 per child and yield substantial benefits
Vitamin A supplementation costs approximately $1 per child and significantly reduces mortality
These figures represent extraordinary humanitarian impact per dollar compared to interventions in many other areas, including those in developed countries where similar outcomes (like extending life by one year) often cost orders of magnitude more.
Strong evidence base
Global health interventions benefit from:
Decades of rigorous randomized controlled trials
Clear, measurable outcomes (lives saved, diseases prevented)
Natural experiments that help establish causality
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses that synthesize evidence
Long-term follow-up studies documenting persistent effects
This robust evidence base allows donors to have high confidence that their contributions are actually achieving the intended impact, addressing a key concern in charitable giving.
Substantial neglectedness
Despite their effectiveness, many global health interventions remain severely underfunded:
Hundreds of millions of people still lack access to proven, cost-effective interventions
Geographic and political distance often reduces natural giving to these causes
Beneficiaries typically lack political voice to advocate for themselves
Market mechanisms alone don't address many of these needs
This neglectedness creates opportunities for donors to fund interventions that would otherwise go unsupported, maximizing the marginal impact of each contribution.
Moral considerations
The ethical case for focusing on global poverty incorporates several compelling elements:
The extreme severity of suffering involved (preventable death, debilitating illness)
The arbitrary nature of global inequality (where someone is born shouldn't determine their life prospects)
The direct responsibility connection (we can clearly identify how our actions address specific needs)
The absence of conflicting values (few moral frameworks would argue against saving lives)
Together, these factors create an unusually strong consensus across different ethical perspectives about the moral importance of addressing these issues.
Tractability advantages
Many global health interventions offer clear, well-established pathways to impact:
Solutions often don't require complex systems change
Delivery mechanisms exist and are scalable
Technical solutions (like vaccines) can often bypass socio-political barriers
Progress is measurable in relatively short timeframes
This tractability contrasts with some other worthy causes where solutions may be more complex or uncertain.
Comparison with other causes
This doesn't mean other causes like education or environmental protection aren't valuable—they absolutely are. However, from an EA perspective, several factors often make direct work on these issues in wealthy countries less competitive for marginal resources:
Education in developed countries already receives substantial funding
Environmental protection faces complex political and economic barriers that may limit cost-effectiveness
Many interventions in these areas show more modest or less certain effects in rigorous evaluations
That said, certain neglected aspects of these broader causes—like education in the poorest countries or environmental issues directly affecting the most vulnerable—can be highly effective giving opportunities that align with EA principles.
Evolving perspectives
The EA community's thinking continues to evolve, with growing attention to:
Long-term effects of global health interventions (economic growth, institutional development)
Potential systemic changes that could address root causes of poverty
Interactions between global health and other priority causes
As evidence, methods, and funding landscapes change, the relative prioritization of different causes will continue to develop. The core commitment remains finding the opportunities where additional resources can do the most good, whatever cause area they might fall within.""

This dual nature makes AI a particularly important area for careful consideration.
As AI safety researcher Dario Amodei explains: ""AI has the potential to be a powerful technology that we can use to make a lot of positive impact in the world. AI and machinery, in particular, have recently been undergoing a period of rapid improvement, and I expect that they will continue to do so. If this is the case, then we can use it to make progress on lots of problems, pressing global problems like global poverty, animal suffering and others.""
This observation highlights the tremendous upside potential of AI technology. Advanced AI systems could help us address many of our most pressing challenges by:
Accelerating scientific research in areas like medicine, clean energy, and climate science
Optimizing resource allocation to reduce waste and increase efficiency
Improving educational outcomes through personalized learning
Enhancing productivity across sectors, potentially reducing poverty and improving living standards
Providing tools that help us make better, more informed decisions
However, Amodei's statement continues with an important caveat: ""But, with any new technology, there's risks that we should understand beforehand so that we can navigate the space and use the technology wisely.""
This balanced perspective reflects a core principle of effective altruism: we should consider both the potential benefits and risks of our actions when determining how to do the most good. In the case of AI, several types of risks deserve serious consideration:
Technical safety risks: As AI systems become more capable, ensuring they reliably do what we want them to do becomes increasingly challenging. Problems like specification gaming (where AI systems optimize for the letter rather than the spirit of their objectives), distributional shift (where systems fail when deployed in environments different from their training), and control issues become more pressing as capabilities advance.
Socioeconomic risks: AI could significantly disrupt labor markets, potentially leading to widespread unemployment or increasing inequality if the benefits are not widely shared. These transitions could be especially challenging if they occur rapidly, outpacing our ability to adapt social systems.
Misuse risks: Powerful AI tools could be deliberately misused by malicious actors, potentially enabling more effective cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, or other harmful activities.
Concentration of power: If advanced AI capabilities become concentrated among a small number of organizations or individuals, this could lead to problematic power imbalances with significant societal implications.
Long-term alignment risks: As AI systems approach or potentially exceed human capabilities in more domains, ensuring these systems remain aligned with human values and intentions becomes a central challenge with potentially significant consequences for humanity's future.
From an effective altruism perspective, several principles can guide our thinking about AI development:
Expected value consideration: We should weigh both the enormous potential benefits and the significant risks, recognizing that small changes in how AI develops could have outsized effects on the future.
Scale sensitivity: The unprecedented scale of AI's potential impact—both positive and negative—makes it particularly important from a cause prioritization perspective.
Neglectedness assessment: While AI development itself receives substantial funding, certain aspects of AI safety and governance remain relatively neglected compared to their importance.
Tractability analysis: We should focus on aspects of AI development where additional attention and resources can meaningfully improve outcomes.
Long-termism: The effects of how we develop AI could persist for generations, making it particularly important to consider long-term consequences.
Practical implications of this analysis might include:
Supporting technical AI safety research
Working toward governance frameworks that promote beneficial development
Ensuring diverse stakeholder participation in shaping AI development
Building field-wide norms around responsible development practices
Preserving society's option value by avoiding irreversible decisions

80000 Hours Podcast,Podcast Trancsript,Neglectdness,Diversity,"This is why I think this is, to some extent, is a social justice and equality issue. Because people who are mostly affected by it are poor farmers in low income communities, who quite often don't have a voice, and can not express, and express their own sorrow and their problems.",I've been learning about neglected problems in effective altruism. It seems like some issues receive less attention because they affect people who lack political or economic power. How does effective altruism think about whose voices and perspectives get prioritized when identifying pressing global problems?,"Your question touches on a crucial consideration in effective altruism: how neglectedness intersects with power, representation, and whose suffering receives attention in our prioritization frameworks.
As climate researcher Valentina Bosetti observes: ""This is why I think this is, to some extent, is a social justice and equality issue. Because people who are mostly affected by it are poor farmers in low income communities, who quite often don't have a voice, and can not express, and express their own sorrow and their problems.""
This insight highlights how neglectedness—a core consideration in EA cause prioritization—often correlates with social, economic, and political marginalization. Problems affecting those with less power tend to receive less attention from markets, governments, and even philanthropy, creating opportunities for particularly high-impact interventions.
The relationship between neglectedness and power imbalances manifests in several important ways:
Structural barriers to voice and representation
People experiencing certain problems may face multiple barriers to advocating for themselves:
Political disenfranchisement: Those without political rights or representation cannot easily influence policy priorities
Geographic distance: Physical and cultural distance between decision-makers and affected populations can reduce awareness and empathy
Resource constraints: Advocacy requires time, money, education, and connections that the most vulnerable often lack
Information asymmetries: Those affected may lack data or evidence to effectively communicate the scale of their suffering
Effective altruists try to account for these barriers by explicitly considering neglectedness in cause prioritization frameworks. This approach acknowledges that market forces and political systems won't necessarily address the most severe suffering, especially when those suffering lack power to demand attention.
Approaching diversity and representation in EA
Effective altruism's approach to these issues combines several elements:
Impartial concern: EA strives to value all suffering equally regardless of who experiences it, as a philosophical commitment
Evidence-seeking: Looking beyond anecdotes or media coverage to systematically identify underrepresented problems
Diverse stakeholder consultation: Engaging with affected communities to understand problems from their perspective
Institutional diversity: Working to build a movement that includes diverse perspectives and experiences
Moral uncertainty: Maintaining humility about whose perspectives might be missing from current analyses
However, these approaches face several practical challenges:
Data gaps: Less data typically exists about problems affecting marginalized communities
Researcher biases: Even well-intentioned researchers bring their own biases to problem analysis
Differential access: The EA community itself has historically drawn heavily from certain demographic groups
Communication barriers: Cultural and linguistic differences can hamper understanding of some problems
Practical implications for more inclusive prioritization
The effective altruism community continues to evolve its approach to these challenges through several strategies:
Investing in research partnerships: Working with organizations embedded in affected communities to better understand problems
Expanding the EA community: Building a more diverse movement that naturally incorporates wider perspectives
Questioning assumptions: Regularly reviewing prioritization frameworks to identify potential blind spots
Emphasizing moral uncertainty: Maintaining humility about the limitations of any single approach to cause prioritization
Developing institutional listening mechanisms: Creating systematic ways to incorporate diverse perspectives into decision-making
An important insight from this analysis is that neglectedness itself serves partly as a corrective to power imbalances in problem prioritization. By explicitly valuing problems that receive less attention relative to their scale and solvability, EA's framework already incorporates a mechanism that tends to elevate issues affecting those with less voice.
That said, the EA community increasingly recognizes that deliberate efforts toward inclusion and diversity strengthen both the movement's analysis and its impact. By combining EA's analytical frameworks with deliberate efforts to incorporate diverse perspectives, we can develop more robust prioritizations that truly reflect our commitment to helping all beings, regardless of their ability to advocate for themselves.","{

As philosophers William MacAskill and Theron Summer explain: ""The effective altruism movement consists of a growing global community of people who use reason and evidence to assess how to do as much good as possible, and who take action on this basis. Launched in 2011, the movement now has thousands of members, as well as influence over billions of dollars.""
At its core, effective altruism combines both a research field and a practical community focused on answering a seemingly simple question: how can we use our resources to help others the most? This question leads to a distinctive approach to charitable giving, career choice, and social impact more broadly.
Core Principles of Effective Altruism
Several key principles define the effective altruist approach:
1. Consequentialism as a starting point Effective altruism evaluates actions primarily by their outcomes rather than intentions or adherence to rules. While EA accommodates different ethical frameworks, it generally focuses on how much good actually results from our choices.
2. Impartiality EA strives to value all individuals equally regardless of geographic location, nationality, species, or timing (present vs. future generations). This impartiality leads to prioritizing issues that might affect geographically distant people or future generations when these issues represent opportunities for particularly high impact.
3. Cost-effectiveness analysis As MacAskill and Summer note: ""The movement has substantially increased awareness of the fact that some altruistic activities are much more cost-effective than others, in the sense that they do much more good than others per unit of resource expended."" This recognition that the best opportunities for impact may be orders of magnitude better than average opportunities fundamentally shapes EA prioritization.
4. Cause prioritization Rather than starting with a specific cause, effective altruism asks which causes offer the best opportunities to do good, typically evaluating causes based on their:
Scale (how much good could be done in this area)
Tractability (how solvable the problems are)
Neglectedness (how many resources are already addressing the problem)
5. Evidence and reason EA emphasizes rigorous analysis and evidence, seeking to minimize cognitive biases and emotional reactions that might lead to suboptimal choices. This doesn't mean ignoring emotions entirely, but rather ensuring they complement rather than override careful assessment.
6. Commitment to action Effective altruism is not merely an intellectual exercise but a commitment to actually doing good based on these analyses, whether through donations, career choices, or other means.
Application to Charitable Giving
In practice, effective altruism has transformed how many people approach charitable giving through several innovations:
1. Charity evaluators As MacAskill and Summer explain: ""Cost‐effectiveness assessments are often centralized within the effective altruist community. For example, GiveWell is devoted to assessing charities that help those in extreme poverty in terms of the additional benefits delivered for each additional dollar donated. Animal Charity Evaluators has a similar mission with respect to charities focusing on animal welfare.""
These organizations conduct in-depth research to identify giving opportunities that maximize impact per dollar, allowing individual donors to benefit from specialized expertise.
2. Focus on impact rather than overhead Rather than evaluating charities based on administrative costs or overhead percentages, EA emphasizes the actual outcomes achieved per dollar spent. A charity with higher overhead might still be more effective if its programs achieve extraordinary results.
3. Counterfactual thinking Effective giving considers what would have happened otherwise—for example, whether a donation truly enables additional work or simply replaces funding that would have come from elsewhere.
4. Giving pledges and communities Organizations like Giving What We Can encourage people to commit to donating a significant portion of their income to effective charities, creating communities that support sustained giving.
Beyond Charitable Giving
Effective altruism extends beyond donations to encompass:
Career choice As the authors note: ""The organization 80,000 Hours specializes in providing advice on choosing careers that enable one to do as much good as possible in one's working life."" This reflects the recognition that career choices can often have more impact than donations, whether through direct work in high-impact areas or earning to give in high-paying fields.
Cause exploration EA research organizations explore promising but neglected cause areas, from global health to existential risks to animal welfare, seeking to identify new opportunities for high-impact work.
Institutional improvement Some effective altruists focus on improving decision-making in governments, corporations, and other institutions to enable better collective choices on important issues

A Dynamic Movement
While effective altruism began with a strong focus on global health and development, the movement has evolved to include work on a range of cause areas, from animal welfare to existential risk reduction to improving institutional decision-making. What unites these diverse efforts is not a specific cause but rather the commitment to using evidence and reason to maximize positive impact, wherever that might lead.
By combining analytical rigor with genuine compassion, effective altruism offers a distinctive approach to making the world better—one that continues to evolve as we learn more about how to do the most good.","{

For example, GiveWell is devoted to assessing charities that help those in extreme poverty in terms of the additional benefits delivered for each additional dollar donated. Animal Charity Evaluators has a similar mission with respect to charities focusing on animal welfare.""
This specialization allows each organization to develop deep expertise in evaluating specific types of interventions. Let's examine how key EA organizations approach cause prioritization in practice:
GiveWell's Approach to Global Health and Development
GiveWell has pioneered rigorous charity evaluation focused primarily on global health and development interventions. Their framework includes:
Evidence of effectiveness: GiveWell places heavy emphasis on high-quality evidence, typically prioritizing interventions with support from randomized controlled trials or similarly rigorous studies. They conduct in-depth literature reviews to assess the strength of evidence for each intervention.
Cost-effectiveness modeling: GiveWell builds detailed models that estimate the impact per dollar for each intervention, typically expressing results in metrics like ""cost per life saved"" or ""cost per doubling consumption."" These models incorporate factors like:
Direct effects on mortality and morbidity
Economic benefits
Developmental effects
Spillover benefits to non-recipients
Room for more funding analysis: Beyond evaluating interventions themselves, GiveWell assesses each organization's ability to effectively use additional funding, analyzing:
Execution quality and track record
Monitoring and evaluation capabilities
Plans for using marginal dollars
Funding gaps and constraints
Transparency and communication: GiveWell prioritizes organizations that openly share information about their work, including challenges and failures, to enable accurate assessment and continuous improvement.
This approach has led GiveWell to recommend interventions like malaria prevention, vitamin A supplementation, and direct cash transfers, which their analysis suggests offer exceptional value per dollar in improving well-being.
80,000 Hours' Career Impact Framework
While GiveWell focuses on charitable donations, 80,000 Hours applies cause prioritization to career decisions. Their framework incorporates:
Problem selection criteria:
Scale: How many people does the problem affect, and how deeply?
Neglectedness: How many resources are already dedicated to addressing the problem?
Tractability: How much progress could we make per unit of resources?
Personal fit: How well-positioned is an individual to contribute to this area?
Career capital assessment: 80,000 Hours evaluates how different career paths build valuable skills, knowledge, credentials, and connections that enable greater impact over time.
Impact evaluation across paths: They compare direct work in promising areas, research, earning to give, advocacy, and field-building, assessing the counterfactual impact of each approach.
Longtermist considerations: As cause prioritization has evolved, 80,000 Hours increasingly incorporates analysis of how careers might affect long-term outcomes for humanity.
This systematic approach helps individuals identify career paths with extraordinary potential for positive impact, often highlighting opportunities in areas like AI safety, biosecurity, and institutional decision-making.
Open Philanthropy's Worldview Diversification
Open Philanthropy, another major EA organization, has developed a more pluralistic approach called ""worldview diversification"" that explicitly accounts for uncertainty between different moral and empirical perspectives:
Multiple worldviews: They maintain separate portfolios for different ""worldviews"" or sets of assumptions about what matters most and how to achieve impact, including:
Global health and wellbeing
Animal welfare
Longtermist perspectives
Other moral perspectives
Hits-based giving: Within each worldview, they often pursue ""hits-based giving""—supporting higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities that might have exceptional impact even if there's substantial uncertainty.
Allocation across worldviews: Resources are allocated between these portfolios based on the strength of evidence, moral weight, and funding gaps within each area.
Cross-Cutting Analytical Tools
Across these organizations, several analytical approaches facilitate cause comparison:
Welfare metrics: Developing common units for comparison, such as:
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)
Subjective well-being measures
Economic metrics like income or consumption
Expected value calculations: Explicitly modeling uncertainty by considering:
Probability of success
Value of information
Option value of different approaches
Moral weights: Formalizing how different effects are valued, such as:
Weighting present vs. future benefits
Comparing human and animal welfare
Valuing different types of improvements (e.g., health vs. income)
Practical Challenges and Adaptations
These frameworks face several practical challenges that EA organizations continue to address:
Measuring indirect effects: Many important impacts occur through complex causal chains that are difficult to measure, leading to ongoing research on how to evaluate systemic change and institutional improvements.
Comparing across domains: It remains challenging to directly compare interventions across very different domains, such as comparing global health interventions with existential risk reduction. Organizations typically maintain some separation between these domains in their analysis.
Incorporating diverse perspectives: As MacAskill and Summer note regarding impartiality, EA strives to value all individuals equally regardless of their circumstances. In practice, this means organizations continuously work to include considerations of equity and justice in their frameworks.
Managing uncertainty: Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting intervention effects, organizations increasingly employ robust sensitivity analysis, explicit model uncertainty, and portfolio approaches to manage this uncertainty.
The sophisticated frameworks developed by EA organizations represent some of the most rigorous attempts to systematically compare diverse opportunities for doing good. While no framework is perfect, these approaches have identified giving and career opportunities that appear to be orders of magnitude more effective than average options, demonstrating the practical value of careful cause prioritization.","{

Organizations like GiveWell and 80,000 Hours have developed specialized approaches to this challenging task, each tailored to their particular focus.
As MacAskill and Summer explain: ""Cost‐effectiveness assessments are often centralized within the effective altruist community. For example, GiveWell is devoted to assessing charities that help those in extreme poverty in terms of the additional benefits delivered for each additional dollar donated. Animal Charity Evaluators has a similar mission with respect to charities focusing on animal welfare.""
This specialization allows each organization to develop deep expertise in evaluating specific types of interventions. Let's examine how key EA organizations approach cause prioritization in practice:
GiveWell's Approach to Global Health and Development
GiveWell has pioneered rigorous charity evaluation focused primarily on global health and development interventions. Their framework includes:
Evidence of effectiveness: GiveWell places heavy emphasis on high-quality evidence, typically prioritizing interventions with support from randomized controlled trials or similarly rigorous studies. They conduct in-depth literature reviews to assess the strength of evidence for each intervention.
Cost-effectiveness modeling: GiveWell builds detailed models that estimate the impact per dollar for each intervention, typically expressing results in metrics like ""cost per life saved"" or ""cost per doubling consumption."" These models incorporate factors like:
Direct effects on mortality and morbidity
Economic benefits
Developmental effects
Spillover benefits to non-recipients
Room for more funding analysis: Beyond evaluating interventions themselves, GiveWell assesses each organization's ability to effectively use additional funding, analyzing:
Execution quality and track record
Monitoring and evaluation capabilities
Plans for using marginal dollars
Funding gaps and constraints
Transparency and communication: GiveWell prioritizes organizations that openly share information about their work, including challenges and failures, to enable accurate assessment and continuous improvement.
This approach has led GiveWell to recommend interventions like malaria prevention, vitamin A supplementation, and direct cash transfers, which their analysis suggests offer exceptional value per dollar in improving well-being.

William MacAskill and Theron Summer,EA Paper,Reasoning,Framework,"Many take effective altruism to be synonymous with utilitarianism… This is a category mistake. Effective altruism is not utilitarianism, nor is it any other normative theory or claim. Instead, effective altruism is the project of using evidence and reason to try to find out how to do the most good…Here, we offer a series of considerations that support and clarify this definition of effective altruism. They are largely driven by how the term
is used by leaders and members of the effective altruism community, as well as by the views and activities of those within the community. We are mindful of the possibility that effective altruism will evolve over time. ",I notice that effective altruism is often associated with utilitarianism. Are they the same thing? What's the relationship between effective altruism and moral philosophy more broadly?,"Effective altruism and utilitarianism are distinct concepts with important relationships, but equating them is what philosophers call a category mistake. Let me clarify their relationship and how effective altruism fits within the broader landscape of moral philosophy.
Effective altruism is best understood as a practical project rather than a moral theory. It's the endeavor of using evidence and reason to determine how to do the most good with our resources, and then taking action based on those findings. As William MacAskill and Theron Summer explain, effective altruism is ""the project of using evidence and reason to try to find out how to do the most good,"" not a specific claim about what makes something good or right.
Utilitarianism, by contrast, is a normative ethical theory that makes specific claims about the nature of right and wrong. Classical utilitarianism holds that the right action is the one that produces the greatest happiness or well-being for the greatest number of beings. It makes strong assertions about what constitutes moral value (well-being) and how we should distribute it (impartially maximizing the total).
The relationship between these concepts has several important dimensions:
Historical and conceptual influence: Utilitarianism has significantly influenced effective altruism. The emphasis on impartial concern, quantification of impact, and maximizing good outcomes shows clear utilitarian roots. Many early effective altruists were influenced by utilitarian philosophers like Peter Singer.
Philosophical diversity within EA: While utilitarianism has been influential, the effective altruism community encompasses people with diverse moral views. Some effective altruists are deontologists who believe in rights and duties, virtue ethicists focused on character development, or adherents to contractualist, prioritarian, or other moral frameworks. What unites them is not a specific moral theory but a commitment to using evidence to maximize positive impact.
Theoretical openness: Effective altruism maintains theoretical openness about what constitutes ""the good."" While many effective altruists focus on increasing well-being, the movement allows for different conceptions of value. Some emphasize autonomy, justice, knowledge, or other values alongside or instead of well-being.
Practical convergence: Different moral theories often converge on similar practical recommendations when faced with extreme suffering or opportunities for great benefit. A rights theorist, virtue ethicist, and utilitarian might all agree on the importance of preventing easily preventable deaths, even while disagreeing on the theoretical reasons why.
This distinction matters because portraying effective altruism as merely ""applied utilitarianism"" mischaracterizes the movement in important ways:
It incorrectly suggests that one must accept utilitarian moral theory to participate
It obscures the intellectual diversity within the movement
It fails to recognize how effective altruism draws from evidence-based practices across many fields beyond moral philosophy
Effective altruism is better understood as a methodology for pursuing altruistic goals rather than a specific answer to fundamental moral questions. It focuses on the practical question of ""how can we do the most good?"" while remaining open to different understandings of what constitutes ""the good"" and why we should pursue it.
This methodological approach makes effective altruism accessible to people with diverse moral views who share the goal of having a substantial positive impact with their resources, whether those resources are money, time, skills, or attention.

William MacAskill and Theron Summer,EA Paper,Cause Prioritization,Framework,"Effective altruism is also impartial in that its tentative aim is to promote well‐being without regard to who in particular has a given amount of well‐being, their race, gender, nationality, and so forth (see impartiality). The outcome in which Anya has 1 unit of well‐being, Basilio has 10 units, and Chloe has 100 units is just as
good, from an impartial point of view, as the outcome in which Chloe has 1 unit of well‐being, Anya has 10 units, and Basilio has 100 units; moreover, we don’t need to know anything further about Anya, Chloe, and Basilio to know that that’s the case.

Impartiality about who in particular has a given amount of well‐being is compatible with prioritizing benefits to the worseoff. Suppose nAnya has 1 unit of well‐being and Basilio has 10 units. We can claim that getting an extra unit of well‐being to Anya has greater priority, or does more to make the outcome better, than getting an extra unit to Basilio, because getting an extra unit to
anyone who has 1 unit has greater priority than getting an extra unit to anyone else who has 10 unit.","I've heard that effective altruism emphasizes impartiality when deciding which causes to support. Could you explain what impartiality means in the EA context, and how it influences decisions about resource allocation? Does this mean everyone's wellbeing should be treated equally regardless of circumstances?","Impartiality is indeed a foundational principle in effective altruism, though its application involves important nuances that go beyond simple equality. As philosophers William MacAskill and Theron Summer explain:
""Effective altruism is also impartial in that its tentative aim is to promote well‐being without regard to who in particular has a given amount of well‐being, their race, gender, nationality, and so forth. The outcome in which Anya has 1 unit of well‐being, Basilio has 10 units, and Chloe has 100 units is just as good, from an impartial point of view, as the outcome in which Chloe has 1 unit of well‐being, Anya has 10 units, and Basilio has 100 units; moreover, we don't need to know anything further about Anya, Chloe, and Basilio to know that that's the case.""
This passage captures the core of impartiality in EA: the intrinsic value of someone's wellbeing doesn't depend on who they are. Your suffering or happiness matters just as much as mine, regardless of where you were born, your nationality, ethnicity, gender, or other characteristics that don't affect your capacity for wellbeing.
However, impartiality in EA isn't simply about treating everyone identically. MacAskill and Summer continue with a crucial clarification:
""Impartiality about who in particular has a given amount of well‐being is compatible with prioritizing benefits to the worse-off. Suppose Anya has 1 unit of well‐being and Basilio has 10 units. We can claim that getting an extra unit of well‐being to Anya has greater priority, or does more to make the outcome better, than getting an extra unit to Basilio, because getting an extra unit to anyone who has 1 unit has greater priority than getting an extra unit to anyone else who has 10 units.""
This distinction is essential for understanding how impartiality works in practice. It means that while everyone's wellbeing is equally valuable in principle, the practical implications often involve directing resources toward those who:
Are currently worse off (where an additional unit of resources can do more good)
Can benefit more from the same resources (where impact per dollar is higher)
Have needs that are more neglected by existing systems
Let's explore how impartiality influences EA cause prioritization in several key dimensions:
Geographic Impartiality
Perhaps the most visible application of impartiality in EA is geographic. While most charitable giving stays within national borders, EA emphasizes that someone's location shouldn't determine how much their wellbeing matters. This leads to significant focus on global health and development, where resources can often help people who:
Are experiencing extreme poverty
Lack access to basic healthcare and other essential services
Could benefit tremendously from relatively small interventions
The dramatic difference in marginal utility between, for example, $1,000 spent on healthcare in a high-income country versus in a low-income country makes geographic impartiality a powerful driver of cost-effectiveness.
Temporal Impartiality
EA also extends impartiality across time, recognizing that future people's wellbeing matters just as much as that of people alive today. This temporal impartiality underlies growing interest in:
Existential risk reduction (preventing catastrophes that could affect future generations)
Long-term institutional improvement
Sustainable solutions to current problems that don't create future harms
The vast numbers of people who might exist in the future, if humanity continues to thrive, mean that even small reductions in existential risk could have enormous expected value when viewed through an impartial lens.
Species Impartiality
Many effective altruists extend impartiality beyond humans to include other sentient beings capable of suffering. This leads to significant interest in:
Farm animal welfare (given the vast numbers of animals in industrial agriculture)
Wild animal suffering
Moral circle expansion (increasing concern for all sentient beings)
Given that there are orders of magnitude more non-human animals than humans on Earth, species impartiality can dramatically affect cause prioritization.
Practical Implications and Nuances
In practice, impartiality in EA interacts with several other considerations:
Diminishing marginal utility: Resources typically produce more wellbeing when given to those who have less, which often leads to prioritizing the worst-off even from an impartial perspective.
Uncertainty and tractability: Even with impartial values, we must consider where our actions can actually make a difference, which depends on evidence, tractability, and implementation capabilities.
Comparative advantage: Different people and organizations have different skills and opportunities, meaning that impartial overall allocation might still involve specialization at the individual level.
Moral uncertainty: Many effective altruists maintain some uncertainty about moral frameworks, leading to approaches like moral diversification that hedge across different ethical perspectives.
Practical constraints: Personal motivation, knowledge limitations, and coordination challenges mean that even deeply committed effective altruists don't pursue pure impartiality in every decision.
A Practical Framework, Not Dogma
It's worth emphasizing that impartiality in EA is a guiding principle rather than an absolute rule. Even the most committed effective altruists recognize the importance of personal relationships, psychological realities, and the benefits of a division of moral labor where different people focus on different issues.
What makes the EA approach distinctive is not that it demands perfect impartiality in every decision, but rather that it asks us to take impartiality seriously as a starting point—to recognize that, all else equal, everyone's wellbeing matters equally, and to let that recognition guide our highest-impact decisions about charitable giving, career choice, and other resources where we can do the most good.","{

William MacAskill and Theron Summer,EA Paper,Cause Neutrality,Framework,"Effective altruism’s impartiality drives what is sometimes referred to as its “cause neutrality,” that is, choosing among the many various possible activities, causes, or problems on the basis of which one(s) enable us to do the most good with limited resources, rather than on the basis of (say) personal connections. Of course, because skills and experiences vary substantially across individuals, it is often the case that different people can do substantially more good by working on different problems. According an instrumental role for personal fit is consistent with acting impartially.","What does it mean for effective altruism to be ""impartial"" or ""cause neutral""? Doesn't everyone need to choose specific causes to work on eventually?","You've touched on an important nuance in effective altruism's approach. Impartiality and cause neutrality are foundational principles in EA, but they function more as starting points for decision-making rather than prescriptions for how everyone should allocate their efforts indefinitely.
Let me unpack both concepts and explain how they operate in practice:
Impartiality in Effective Altruism
Impartiality in EA means that when assessing the value of helping different individuals, we don't give preference based on morally arbitrary characteristics like nationality, race, gender, or proximity to ourselves. As MacAskill and Summer explain, from an impartial perspective, the distribution of well-being matters, but not which specific individuals experience which levels of well-being.
This doesn't mean treating everyone identically. EA's impartiality is compatible with prioritizing benefits to those who are worse off. If Anya has 1 unit of well-being and Basilio has 10 units, an impartial view might still prioritize helping Anya first, not because of who she is specifically, but because helping those with less well-being may do more good.
Similarly, impartiality doesn't require ignoring personal relationships or eliminating special obligations to family and friends. Rather, it serves as a guiding principle for decisions about how to use resources specifically dedicated to helping others effectively.
Cause Neutrality in Effective Altruism
Cause neutrality is the application of impartiality to choosing which problems to work on. In its ideal form, it means selecting causes based on where you can do the most good with your resources, rather than because of personal connections, emotional attachments, or what happens to be salient in your community.
However, cause neutrality doesn't mean everyone should work on the same issues. Here's why effective altruists still specialize in different areas:
Comparative advantage: People have different skills, experiences, and knowledge. Someone with medical training might do more good focusing on global health, while someone with AI expertise might have more impact working on AI safety.
Diminishing returns: As more resources flow into a cause, the marginal impact of additional resources typically decreases. This creates incentives for diversification across promising areas.
Uncertainty about impact: Given our limited knowledge, there's value in exploring multiple potentially high-impact causes rather than putting all resources into what currently seems best.
Motivation and sustainability: People typically make greater contributions when working on issues they find intrinsically motivating. Effective altruism recognizes that personal fit can be instrumentally important for long-term impact.
Reconciling Principles and Practice
In practice, effective altruism works like this:
Start with cause neutrality: Approach the question of where to focus with an open mind, considering diverse cause areas.
Apply evidence and reasoning: Assess different opportunities based on scale, tractability, and neglectedness, as well as your personal fit.
Specialize strategically: After this assessment, specialize in areas where you can contribute most effectively, while maintaining awareness of other priorities.
Reassess periodically: As evidence evolves and circumstances change, be willing to reconsider your focus.
The EA community as a whole benefits from having individuals specialized in different causes, creating a division of labor. Organizations like GiveWell, Animal Charity Evaluators, and 80,000 Hours have each specialized in evaluating different types of interventions, which helps the broader community make more informed decisions.
The key distinction is that in effective altruism, cause selection emerges from an impartial assessment process rather than being predetermined by personal circumstances or emotional reactions. This approach doesn't eliminate specialization, but it changes how we decide where to specialize.

Impartiality in EA means that when assessing the value of helping different individuals, we don't give preference based on morally arbitrary characteristics like nationality, race, gender, or proximity to ourselves. As MacAskill and Summer explain, from an impartial perspective, the distribution of well-being matters, but not which specific individuals experience which levels of well-being.
This doesn't mean treating everyone identically. EA's impartiality is compatible with prioritizing benefits to those who are worse off. If Anya has 1 unit of well-being and Basilio has 10 units, an impartial view might still prioritize helping Anya first, not because of who she is specifically, but because helping those with less well-being may do more good.
Similarly, impartiality doesn't require ignoring personal relationships or eliminating special obligations to family and friends. Rather, it serves as a guiding principle for decisions about how to use resources specifically dedicated to helping others effectively.
Cause Neutrality in Effective Altruism
Cause neutrality is the application of impartiality to choosing which problems to work on. In its ideal form, it means selecting causes based on where you can do the most good with your resources, rather than because of personal connections, emotional attachments, or what happens to be salient in your community.
However, cause neutrality doesn't mean everyone should work on the same issues. Here's why effective altruists still specialize in different areas:
Comparative advantage: People have different skills, experiences, and knowledge. Someone with medical training might do more good focusing on global health, while someone with AI expertise might have more impact working on AI safety.
Diminishing returns: As more resources flow into a cause, the marginal impact of additional resources typically decreases. This creates incentives for diversification across promising areas.
Uncertainty about impact: Given our limited knowledge, there's value in exploring multiple potentially high-impact causes rather than putting all resources into what currently seems best.
Motivation and sustainability: People typically make greater contributions when working on issues they find intrinsically motivating. Effective altruism recognizes that personal fit can be instrumentally important for long-term impact.
Reconciling Principles and Practice
In practice, effective altruism works like this:
Start with cause neutrality: Approach the question of where to focus with an open mind, considering diverse cause areas.
Apply evidence and reasoning: Assess different opportunities based on scale, tractability, and neglectedness, as well as your personal fit.
Specialize strategically: After this assessment, specialize in areas where you can contribute most effectively, while maintaining awareness of other priorities.
Reassess periodically: As evidence evolves and circumstances change, be willing to reconsider your focus.
The EA community as a whole benefits from having individuals specialized in different causes, creating a division of labor. Organizations like GiveWell, Animal Charity Evaluators, and 80,000 Hours have each specialized in evaluating different types of interventions, which helps the broader community make more informed decisions.
The key distinction is that in effective altruism, cause selection emerges from an impartial assessment process rather than being predetermined by personal circumstances or emotional reactions. This approach doesn't eliminate specialization, but it changes how we decide where to specialize.

William MacAskill and Theron Summer,EA Paper,Sustainable Giving,Framework,"If effective altruism is the project of using evidence and reason to try to find out how to do the most good, and on this basis trying to do the most good, then what is an effective altruist? We do not believe that, to be an effective altruist, one must always be engaged in or motivated by effective altruism. Most if not all effective altruists have a variety of projects in their lives besides effective altruism, even if effective altruism is one of their most central projects. So it seems one need not be a perfect effective altruist to be an effective altruist. Similarly, occasionally running
slower than you are able to does not disqualify you from being a fast runner. Being a fast runner is a matter of running fast enough, and being an effective altruist is a matter of engaging in effective altruism enough. Perhaps significant engagement is enough. If “enough” or “significant” is hopelessly arbitrary or vague, we can instead construe being an effective altruist as purely a matter of degree, corresponding to the degree to which one engages in effective altruism.","What exactly does it mean to be an 'effective altruist'? Do I need to dedicate my entire life to maximizing the good I can do, or is there a more moderate understanding of what it means to participate in this movement?","Being an 'effective altruist' doesn't require total dedication of your life to maximizing good—rather, it involves meaningful engagement with evidence-based approaches to doing good, alongside your other life projects and commitments.
William MacAskill and Theron Summer address this question directly in their work on defining effective altruism. They begin by defining effective altruism itself as ""the project of using evidence and reason to try to find out how to do the most good, and on this basis trying to do the most good."" But they recognize that this immediately raises the question: what does it mean for a person to be an effective altruist?
Their answer is refreshingly nuanced. They argue that being an effective altruist doesn't require that you're always engaged in or motivated by effective altruist principles in everything you do. In fact, most people deeply involved in effective altruism have many other projects and commitments in their lives, even if effective altruism represents one of their central concerns.
MacAskill and Summer offer a helpful analogy: occasionally running slower than you're capable of doesn't disqualify you from being considered a fast runner. Being a fast runner means running fast enough, not running at maximum speed at all times. Similarly, being an effective altruist means engaging with effective altruism enough, not perfectly maximizing good in every moment of your life.
This ""enough"" is deliberately left somewhat open-ended. They suggest that ""significant engagement"" might be sufficient, though they acknowledge the potential vagueness of this standard. Alternatively, we might think of being an effective altruist as a matter of degree, corresponding to how much one engages with the project of using evidence and reason to do the most good.
This moderate understanding addresses several common misperceptions about effective altruism:
First, it acknowledges that moral perspectives that permit us not to always maximize good aren't objections to effective altruism itself. The fact that it's morally permissible not to always engage in a project doesn't count against the value of that project.
Second, it recognizes that most moral frameworks include other important values and obligations besides maximizing good—such as obligations not to harm others, to avoid lying or stealing, and special obligations to friends and family. These considerations can legitimately constrain how and when we pursue the maximization of good. This leads MacAskill and Summer to endorse a qualified definition of effective altruism that includes ""without violating constraints"" in its formulation.
Third, it leaves room for both individualistic and collective approaches to doing good. While much effective altruist thinking focuses on what individuals can do, MacAskill and Summer deliberately leave open whether the central question should be ""How can I do the most good?"" or ""How can we together do the most good?"" They recognize that collective approaches might address coordination problems and achieve outcomes impossible through purely individual action.
Underlying all of this is what they call the ""minimal view""—that we have reason to benefit others regardless of their race, gender, nationality, and other arbitrary characteristics, more reason to benefit them more, and most reason to benefit them as much as possible (other things being equal). This minimal view is ""portable"" across many different moral frameworks and provides an ecumenical basis for effective altruism accessible to people with diverse philosophical commitments.
In practice, this means you can meaningfully participate in effective altruism while:
Having a career outside of explicitly effective altruist causes
Maintaining special relationships with friends and family
Having hobbies and personal projects
Respecting moral constraints like avoiding harm
What makes someone an effective altruist is significant engagement with the project of using evidence and reason to do more good—whether through charitable giving, career choices, volunteer work, advocacy, or other means—not perfect adherence to an all-encompassing lifestyle.","{

William MacAskill and Theron Summer,EA Paper,Theory vs. Practice,Framework,"The effective altruist project has two aspects, one intellectual and the other practical. The intellectual aspect is trying to find out how to do the most good through the use of reason and evidence (involving empirical sciences as well as epistemology, ethics, and decision theory). The practical aspect is trying to do the most good, which consists in altruistic activity based on or informed by the intellectual aspect.","Some people argue that being an effective altruist means always maximizing the good you can do, which seems extremely demanding. Does effective altruism require perfect adherence to its principles, or can someone still be considered an effective altruist while balancing other priorities in their life?","Effective altruism is best understood as a significant commitment rather than an all-or-nothing identity that requires perfect adherence. The degree to which someone is an effective altruist corresponds to the degree they engage with the project of using evidence and reason to do the most good.
Think of effective altruism as having two interconnected aspects:
An intellectual aspect: Using reason and evidence to determine how to do the most good
A practical aspect: Taking action based on those conclusions
Most effective altruists have a variety of projects and commitments in their lives besides effective altruism, even if it represents one of their central concerns. This is entirely consistent with being an effective altruist—just as occasionally running slower than your top speed doesn't disqualify you from being a fast runner. Being a fast runner means running fast enough, and being an effective altruist means engaging in effective altruism enough.
This more nuanced view offers several important insights:
First, it recognizes that engaging with effective altruism is a matter of degree. Some people may dedicate their careers and a substantial portion of their income to effective causes, while others might donate a smaller percentage of their income while maintaining various other commitments.
Second, effective altruism doesn't necessarily entail a utilitarian moral framework that demands maximizing good consequences in every decision. The movement accommodates a range of moral views, including those that recognize other moral considerations like personal relationships, rights, and virtues.
Third, many effective altruists explicitly acknowledge that we have special obligations to friends and family, and that these relationships may sometimes take precedence over impartial beneficence. Some even argue that maintaining these relationships makes us more effective in the long run by preventing burnout and sustaining our commitment.
Fourth, the ""demandingness"" concern often stems from a misunderstanding. Effective altruism encourages us to do more good with the resources we've decided to allocate toward helping others—it doesn't necessarily dictate how much of our resources we should allocate in the first place.
Indeed, the effective altruism community has moved toward a more sustainable approach over time, recognizing that trying to push beyond one's limits often leads to burnout rather than sustained impact. Many leading voices in the movement emphasize the importance of finding a sustainable level of commitment that you can maintain over the long term.
What effective altruism does ask is that, when you do decide to help others, you try to do so as effectively as possible. This seems hard to argue against—if you're going to help others, why not help them as much as you can with the resources you've dedicated to that purpose?

William MacAskill and Theron Summer,EA Paper,Objection,,"It is morally permissible not to always try to promote as much good as possible. Whether or not this claim is true, it is no objection to effective altruism. That it is permissible not to always engage in some project does not itself count against doing so.","I'm trying to balance being an effective altruist with having a normal life, including spending on myself and loved ones. How can I apply EA principles to decide what's a reasonable balance without feeling guilty about not maximizing every possible opportunity to do good?","Balancing effective altruism with a fulfilling personal life is a practical challenge many committed EAs face. Let me walk you through a concrete approach to finding your balance without sacrificing either your impact or your wellbeing.
Step 1: Recognize that moral permissibility doesn't require maximizing at all times
Start with a clear understanding of EA's actual philosophical position:
As MacAskill and Summer explicitly state: ""It is morally permissible not to always try to promote as much good as possible."" They further clarify that ""this is no objection to effective altruism. That it is permissible not to always engage in some project does not itself count against doing so.""
This isn't just a convenient interpretation—it's a core position of EA philosophers. Effective altruism doesn't require maximizing good in every decision; it's about using evidence and reason to do good effectively when you choose to do so.
Step 2: Define concrete giving targets based on your circumstances
Instead of an abstract ""maximize at all times"" approach, develop specific targets:
Financial giving:
Consider the Giving What We Can pledge (10% of income) as a reference point
Adjust based on your financial situation:
If you're paying off high-interest debt, you might start at 1-2%
If you're financially secure with high income, you might give more than 10%
Set a specific percentage that feels sustainable long-term
Time commitment:
Allocate a specific number of hours weekly or monthly to EA activities
Protect this time as you would any important commitment
Be realistic about your energy and other responsibilities
Career decisions:
Identify the 2-3 next career moves that best balance impact and personal fit
Don't compare yourself to theoretical ideals, but to realistic alternatives you could actually sustain
Step 3: Create clear boundaries and dedicated spaces
Implement practical boundaries to prevent constant optimization pressure:
Budget boundaries:
Create separate mental accounts for:
Giving (your committed donation amount)
Necessities (housing, food, healthcare)
Personal discretionary spending (guilt-free)
Once you've allocated to giving, don't continually question spending from other categories
Time boundaries:
Designate specific times for EA-related activities
Protect time for personal relationships and self-care
Avoid letting impact considerations infiltrate every moment
Decision categories:
High-stakes decisions: Apply thorough EA analysis (career changes, major donations)
Medium-stakes decisions: Brief consideration of impact (vacation planning, major purchases)
Low-stakes decisions: Minimal or no EA analysis (daily consumer choices, leisure activities)
Step 4: Apply the concept of sustainable impact maximization
Frame your approach around long-term impact, not short-term sacrifice:
Sustainability principle: ""The approach that produces the most good over your lifetime is one you can sustain for decades, not one that leads to burnout in months or years.""
Practical applications:
Build gradually: Start with manageable commitments and increase them as they become comfortable
Monitor for warning signs: Set up regular check-ins about your EA engagement level
Value your effectiveness: Recognize that your ability to do good depends on your wellbeing
Example calculation: Giving 10% consistently for 40 years produces far more good than giving 50% for 2 years followed by burnout and disengagement.
Step 5: Implement a periodic review system
Create a structured process to reassess your balance:
Quarterly review:
Assess your giving against targets
Evaluate sustainability and satisfaction
Make incremental adjustments as needed
Annual deeper review:
Reassess your overall approach and capacity
Consider whether to increase commitments
Reflect on your growth as an effective altruist
Step 6: Practice healthy psychological framing
Adopt specific cognitive frameworks that support sustainable engagement:
Agency-based framing: ""I'm choosing to direct X% of my resources toward effective giving, which is Y times more than the average person with my income.""
Growth mindset: ""I'm developing my capacity for impact over time, not expecting perfection immediately.""
Portfolio thinking: ""Different parts of my life serve different values, and that's appropriate.""
A concrete example:
Sarah earns $70,000 and initially felt guilty about any non-essential spending. She implemented this balanced approach:
She committed to giving 10% ($7,000) annually to GiveWell-recommended charities
She created a separate ""giving account"" where she automatically deposits this money monthly
She established clear categories for remaining funds:
50% for necessities
20% for savings/investment
20% for discretionary spending she enjoys without guilt
She dedicates 3 hours weekly to EA-related activities and research
She conducts quarterly reviews of this system, gradually increasing her giving as her income grows
She focuses her most rigorous EA analysis on major life decisions, not daily choices
This approach has allowed her to maintain her commitment for years, gradually increase her impact, and advocate effectively for EA principles without experiencing burnout or resentment.
By approaching this challenge systematically, you can develop a sustainable balance that honors both your commitment to doing good effectively and your needs as a human being with multiple values and relationships.","{

William MacAskill and Theron Summer,EA Paper,Objection,,"We are morally obligated not to always try to promote as much good as possible. For example, we have obligations not to harm others, steal, lie, and so forth, and we have obligations to put our friends and family ahead of strangers. These obligations can often outweigh reasons or obligations to promote the good, and thus constitute constraints on promoting the good. Always trying to promote the most good may involve harming others, stealing, lying, and neglecting friends and family. 

An objection to always trying to promote the most good is no objection to trying to promote the most good in some but not all circumstances, or aspects of life. This is not a wholly satisfactory response, as it leaves it open that being a perfect effective altruist, or always engaging in effective altruism, would involve violating constraints. We therefore endorse a qualified definition of effective altruism, according to which effective altruism is the project of using evidence and reason to try to find out how to do the most good, and on this basis trying to do the most good, without violating constraint.","Some philosophical perspectives hold that we have special obligations to those close to us, like family and friends, that can sometimes outweigh impartial obligations to strangers. How does effective altruism handle this tension between partial and impartial obligations?","Effective altruism recognizes and accommodates the tension between partial obligations to those close to us and impartial obligations to strangers in several nuanced ways, rather than demanding strict impartiality in all contexts.
MacAskill and Summer directly address this tension in their philosophical work. They acknowledge that most moral frameworks include special obligations to friends and family that can sometimes outweigh or constrain impartial obligations to promote the general good. Far from dismissing these partial obligations, they incorporate them into their understanding of effective altruism in several important ways.
First, they recognize that always trying to maximize impartial good might sometimes conflict with these special obligations. As they note, ""Always trying to promote the most good may involve...neglecting friends and family."" Rather than ignoring this potential conflict, they modify their definition of effective altruism to accommodate it.
They propose a ""qualified definition of effective altruism"" that includes the phrase ""without violating constraints."" This qualification explicitly acknowledges that the pursuit of impartial good operates within boundaries set by other moral considerations, including special obligations to those close to us. In this view, effective altruism doesn't require sacrificing these relationships on the altar of impartial maximization.
Second, they present effective altruism as compatible with a ""minimal view"" about impartial obligations. This minimal view holds that we have reason to benefit others impartially, more reason to benefit them more, and most reason to benefit them as much as possible—but importantly, these reasons apply ""defeasibly and if other things are equal."" The qualifiers ""defeasibly"" and ""if other things are equal"" leave room for special obligations to sometimes override impartial considerations.
This minimal view is deliberately designed to be ""portable"" across different moral frameworks, including those that recognize robust special obligations. They explicitly note that they ""need not here insist on how much weight [reasons of beneficence] have relative to other reasons (for example, to benefit oneself or one's near and dear)."" This agnosticism about the precise weight of impartial versus partial obligations makes effective altruism compatible with a range of positions on this question.
Third, they frame effective altruism as a project focused on using evidence and reason to do the most good, not as a comprehensive moral theory that must answer all questions about competing obligations. This allows effective altruists to draw on various moral frameworks when navigating these tensions, rather than imposing a single rigid approach.
In practice, this nuanced philosophical understanding translates into several approaches within the effective altruist community:
Many effective altruists maintain what philosophers call a ""multi-level"" approach to ethics, where they honor special obligations to family and friends in daily life while also dedicating significant resources to helping strangers effectively.
Some focus effective altruism primarily on certain domains of their lives (like charitable giving or career choices) while approaching other domains (like personal relationships) with different moral considerations in mind.
Others adopt a ""satisficing"" approach where they aim to do ""enough"" good impartially while also fulfilling their special obligations, rather than strictly maximizing impartial good at all times.
The community generally respects that individuals must find their own balance between partial and impartial obligations, based on their broader moral commitments and personal circumstances. This pluralistic approach allows effective altruism to remain accessible to people with diverse views on the strength of special obligations.
By acknowledging these tensions rather than dismissing them, effective altruism offers a framework that can complement, rather than compete with, special obligations to those close to us. It suggests that we can meaningfully pursue evidence-based approaches to doing good impartially while still honoring the special relationships that give our lives meaning.","{

            ""content"": ""Effective altruism recognizes and accommodates the tension between partial obligations to those close to us and impartial obligations to strangers in several nuanced ways, rather than demanding strict impartiality in all contexts.
MacAskill and Summer directly address this tension in their philosophical work. They acknowledge that most moral frameworks include special obligations to friends and family that can sometimes outweigh or constrain impartial obligations to promote the general good. Far from dismissing these partial obligations, they incorporate them into their understanding of effective altruism in several important ways.
First, they recognize that always trying to maximize impartial good might sometimes conflict with these special obligations. As they note, ""Always trying to promote the most good may involve...neglecting friends and family."" Rather than ignoring this potential conflict, they modify their definition of effective altruism to accommodate it.
They propose a ""qualified definition of effective altruism"" that includes the phrase ""without violating constraints."" This qualification explicitly acknowledges that the pursuit of impartial good operates within boundaries set by other moral considerations, including special obligations to those close to us. In this view, effective altruism doesn't require sacrificing these relationships on the altar of impartial maximization.
Second, they present effective altruism as compatible with a ""minimal view"" about impartial obligations. This minimal view holds that we have reason to benefit others impartially, more reason to benefit them more, and most reason to benefit them as much as possible—but importantly, these reasons apply ""defeasibly and if other things are equal."" The qualifiers ""defeasibly"" and ""if other things are equal"" leave room for special obligations to sometimes override impartial considerations.
This minimal view is deliberately designed to be ""portable"" across different moral frameworks, including those that recognize robust special obligations. They explicitly note that they ""need not here insist on how much weight [reasons of beneficence] have relative to other reasons (for example, to benefit oneself or one's near and dear)."" This agnosticism about the precise weight of impartial versus partial obligations makes effective altruism compatible with a range of positions on this question.
Third, they frame effective altruism as a project focused on using evidence and reason to do the most good, not as a comprehensive moral theory that must answer all questions about competing obligations. This allows effective altruists to draw on various moral frameworks when navigating these tensions, rather than imposing a single rigid approach.
In practice, this nuanced philosophical understanding translates into several approaches within the effective altruist community:
Many effective altruists maintain what philosophers call a ""multi-level"" approach to ethics, where they honor special obligations to family and friends in daily life while also dedicating significant resources to helping strangers effectively.
Some focus effective altruism primarily on certain domains of their lives (like charitable giving or career choices) while approaching other domains (like personal relationships) with different moral considerations in mind.
Others adopt a ""satisficing"" approach where they aim to do ""enough"" good impartially while also fulfilling their special obligations, rather than strictly maximizing impartial good at all times.
The community generally respects that individuals must find their own balance between partial and impartial obligations, based on their broader moral commitments and personal circumstances. This pluralistic approach allows effective altruism to remain accessible to people with diverse views on the strength of special obligations.
By acknowledging these tensions rather than dismissing them, effective altruism offers a framework that can complement, rather than compete with, special obligations to those close to us. It suggests that we can meaningfully pursue evidence-based approaches to doing good impartially while still honoring the special relationships that give our lives meaning.""

William MacAskill and Theron Summer,EA Paper,Objection,,"it is a wholly individualistic project, where the guiding question for each engaged in the project is “How can I do the most good, given what others are likely to do?” There seem to be many

Further, there are general and familiar Kantian worries of the form “What if everyone did that?” For these various reasons, it may be undesirable to construe effective altruism as a solely individualistic project.

This openness allows effective altruism to incorporate the collective question: ""How can we together do the most good?""
Practical Examples of Collective Approaches in EA
This theoretical flexibility has translated into several concrete collective approaches within effective altruism:
1. Coordination mechanisms for donors
Organizations like Giving What We Can and the EA Funds create structures that enable donors to coordinate their giving in ways that overcome collective action problems:
Pledging communities: Thousands of people have publicly committed to donate a significant portion of their income through the Giving What We Can pledge. This creates mutual knowledge that helps overcome the ""drop in the bucket"" concern that one's individual donations won't matter.
Donation pooling: EA Funds aggregate donations from many individuals to achieve scale effects that wouldn't be possible through fragmented individual giving. For example, their Animal Welfare Fund can support early-stage organizations that might be too risky for any individual donor.
Donation trading: The EA community facilitates ""moral trade"" where people with different values or priorities can coordinate to achieve more of what each values than they could individually.
2. Institutional reform and policy work
Many EA organizations focus explicitly on improving institutions and policies that shape collective action:
Improving institutional decision-making: Organizations like the Centre for Effective Altruism have dedicated programs focused on enhancing how governments and large organizations make decisions that affect millions.
Policy advocacy: Groups like the Centre for Global Development work on reforming international development policies to create more effective systems for addressing global poverty.
Governance innovation: Research on alternative voting systems, prediction markets, and other mechanisms to improve collective decision-making represents a growing area within EA.
3. Field-building and coordination
EA has increasingly focused on building communities of practice around important problem areas:
AI governance: Rather than just individual research projects, EA has helped create an interdisciplinary community working on AI alignment and governance challenges.
Global health security: EA organizations have worked to connect researchers, policymakers, and funders to build capacity for pandemic prevention.
Alternative protein development: Organizations like the Good Food Institute coordinate research, policy work, and industry engagement to advance meat alternatives collectively.
4. Research coordination and prioritization
The EA community has developed mechanisms to coordinate research efforts:
Research agendas: Organizations like the Global Priorities Institute and Future of Humanity Institute develop research agendas that help align individual researchers' efforts.
Forecasting platforms: Tools like Metaculus aggregate predictions from many individuals to improve collective foresight.
Research prioritization: Systematic efforts to identify neglected research areas help direct talent and funding toward the most important open questions.
The Future of Collective Approaches in EA
As MacAskill and Summer note, ""There is undoubtedly more work to be done in this area, both in theory and in practice."" The EA community continues to develop more sophisticated approaches to collective action:
Stronger coordination mechanisms: New tools and platforms that facilitate coordination across different actors working on similar problems
Institutional design research: Growing interest in how to design better institutions and decision-making processes
Movement building: Strategic focus on growing communities committed to effective approaches to doing good
Global collaboration: Increased attention to building EA communities worldwide to address problems that require truly global coordination
This evolution toward more collective approaches doesn't abandon EA's commitment to evidence and effectiveness.

William MacAskill and Theron Summer,EA Paper,Theory vs. Practice,Framework,"We find it hard to deny the minimal view that we have reason
to benefit all others, regardless of their race, gender, nationality, and so forth, and more reason to benefit them more, and most reason to benefit them as much as possible, at least defeasibly and if other things are equal. This minimal view is “portable”
in the sense that it can be found in a wide variety of normative theories. While we believe the reasons of beneficence implied by the minimal view are of nontrivial weight, we need not here insist on how much weight they have relative to other reasons (for example, to benefit oneself or one’s near and dear). There are further questions of whether and when these reasons of beneficence give rise to obligations, and how such obligations would interact with moral options to sometimes do less than
what is impartially best. For now, we note only that the minimal view provides a relatively uncontroversial and ecumenical basis for effective altruism.","What does the 'minimal view' in effective altruism mean, and how might it help someone who is new to EA principles start applying them in their everyday decisions?","The 'minimal view' in effective altruism provides an accessible entry point for newcomers by focusing on core principles that most people can accept, regardless of their broader ethical beliefs. Let me explain what this view entails and how it can help you begin applying EA principles to everyday decisions.
Understanding the Minimal View
According to MacAskill and Summer, the minimal view consists of a straightforward set of principles about our reasons to help others:
""We have reason to benefit all others, regardless of their race, gender, nationality, and so forth, and more reason to benefit them more, and most reason to benefit them as much as possible, at least defeasibly and if other things are equal.""
Let's break this down into its key components:
Universal consideration: We have reason to benefit everyone, regardless of characteristics like their nationality, race, or where they live. This doesn't mean treating everyone identically, but it does mean considering everyone's welfare as morally important.
Scale sensitivity: All else equal, we have stronger reasons to provide greater benefits rather than smaller ones. Helping someone a lot matters more than helping them a little.
Maximization principle: We have strongest reason to do as much good as possible with our resources, though this principle is ""defeasible"" (can be overridden) and applies when ""other things are equal.""
Portability across moral theories: This view is ""portable"" because it can be found in many different moral frameworks, from utilitarianism to virtue ethics to religious moral systems.
The minimal view doesn't specify:
Exactly how much weight to give these reasons compared to other considerations
Whether these reasons create strict obligations or simply suggestions
How to balance helping others against personal projects and relationships
This openness makes the minimal view widely acceptable while still providing meaningful guidance for practical decisions.
Applying the Minimal View to Everyday Decisions
Here are concrete ways to begin applying this minimal view in your daily life:
1. Charitable Giving Decisions
Start with cause prioritization:
Ask: ""Where can my donation help people the most?""
Consider both the scale of different problems and how effectively they can be addressed
Look to resources like GiveWell that identify particularly effective giving opportunities
Apply the impartiality principle:
Question whether you're giving preference to local causes simply because they're nearby
Consider whether your donation might do more good addressing extreme poverty globally
This doesn't mean never giving locally, but making location-based decisions deliberately
Begin with a manageable commitment:
Start with a modest giving pledge that feels sustainable (perhaps 1-3% of income)
Research where this money can do the most good
Gradually increase your commitment as you become more comfortable
2. Career Decisions
Consider impact alongside personal fit:
When evaluating career options, explicitly include ""impact on others"" as a decision factor
This doesn't mean ignoring personal strengths and interests, but including impact in your calculation
Ask: ""How might this role allow me to benefit others through my work?""
Think broadly about impact paths:
Direct impact: Directly helping others through your work (e.g., healthcare, education)
Earning to give: Earning money to donate to effective causes
Building skills: Developing capabilities that will enable you to have more impact later
Advocating for change: Influencing others to also consider how they can do more good
Start with manageable steps:
You don't need to completely change careers immediately
Consider how you could increase your impact in your current role
Look for opportunities to develop skills that could enable more impactful work in the future
3. Consumption Choices
Practice intentional consumption:
When making significant purchases, pause to consider the impact of different options
Ask: ""Could some of this money do more good elsewhere?""
This doesn't mean never enjoying yourself, but making trade-offs consciously
Consider ethical dimensions:
Research the impact of your consumption on others (e.g., labor conditions, environmental effects)
Look for opportunities where ethical choices align with effectiveness
Prioritize changes that make the biggest difference rather than those that feel most virtuous
Focus on significant decisions:
Don't stress about every small choice, which can lead to burnout
Pay special attention to major decisions like housing, transportation, and large purchases
Remember that the goal is sustainable impact, not perfectionism
4. Time and Attention Allocation
Dedicate time to impact:
Set aside specific time for impact-focused activities (volunteering, research, skill-building)
Start with a manageable commitment (perhaps a few hours monthly)
Gradually increase as you find effective uses of your time
Seek leverage:
Look for opportunities where your time can have multiplier effects
This might include influencing others, building important infrastructure, or creating resources others can use
Ask: ""How can I use my time to benefit many people rather than just a few?""
Build knowledge systematically:
Invest time in learning about important problems and effective solutions
Follow organizations like 80,000 Hours, GiveWell, or the Centre for Effective Altruism
Join local EA groups or online communities to learn from others
The Minimal View as a Starting Point
Remember that the minimal view is intentionally a starting point, not a complete moral theory. As MacAskill and Summer note:
""While we believe the reasons of beneficence implied by the minimal view are of nontrivial weight, we need not here insist on how much weight they have relative to other reasons (for example, to benefit oneself or one's near and dear).""
This means you can begin applying these principles while continuing to develop your own understanding of how they fit with your broader values and commitments. Many effective altruists maintain meaningful personal relationships, pursue their own projects, and live balanced lives while also taking seriously their ability to benefit others.
The minimal view doesn't require you to maximize impact in every decision or sacrifice all personal priorities. Instead, it encourages incorporating considerations of how you can benefit others into your decision-making processes alongside other important values.
As you become more comfortable with these basic principles, you can explore more sophisticated aspects of effective altruism, such as cause prioritization frameworks, detailed impact measurement, or specialized areas like existential risk reduction or animal welfare. But the minimal view provides a solid foundation for beginning to apply effective altruism principles in your everyday life.","{

"""The Philosophical Core of Effective Altruism” Brian Berkey",Journal Excerpt,,,"The organizations recommended by GiveWell focus primarily on improving the lives of people in some of the poorest parts of the world. This focus reflects both the fact that the needs that can be met in these places through the contributions that effective altruists encourage are, on any plausible view, of great moral importance, and the fact that these needs can typically be met more cheaply than any similarly important needs in wealthier parts of the world. Effective altruism has, then, adopted a global orientation, involving a commitment to consider the needs and interests of everyone as equally morally important, regardless of where they happen to live. This Cosmopolitan Impartiality, as I will call it, is, in my view, also a core commitment of effective altruism. Those who accept Cosmopolitan Impartiality believe that there are strong reasons to direct one's charitable resources wherever they will do the most good, impartially understood.","I'm trying to decide between donating to a local homeless shelter and an international charity focused on global health. How would I apply effective altruism principles to make this decision, especially considering the idea of 'Cosmopolitan Impartiality'?","Deciding between supporting a local homeless shelter and an international global health charity presents a perfect opportunity to apply effective altruism principles in practice. Let me walk you through a structured approach that incorporates the concept of Cosmopolitan Impartiality while providing a practical framework for your decision.
Understanding Cosmopolitan Impartiality
As Brian Berkey explains, Cosmopolitan Impartiality is a core commitment of effective altruism that involves ""considering the needs and interests of everyone as equally morally important, regardless of where they happen to live."" This principle suggests that when deciding where to direct your charitable resources, you should focus on where they will do the most good from an impartial perspective.
This doesn't mean you must ignore local causes, but rather that you should evaluate both options based on their impact rather than proximity. As Berkey notes, GiveWell's focus on global interventions reflects two key facts:
The needs in the poorest parts of the world are of ""great moral importance""
These needs can ""typically be met more cheaply than any similarly important needs in wealthier parts of the world""
Let's apply this understanding to your specific decision.
Step 1: Assess the comparative impact of each option
Start by gathering concrete information about what each donation could accomplish:
For the local homeless shelter:
Operational costs: Research the cost per person served (perhaps $30-50 per night)
Services provided: What specific needs are addressed (shelter, food, case management)?
Current funding situation: Is the shelter adequately funded or facing shortfalls?
Alternative funding sources: Are there local government resources or other donors?
For the global health charity:
Intervention effectiveness: What specific health interventions do they implement?
Cost-effectiveness estimates: For example, malaria prevention typically costs around $2,000-$5,000 per life saved
Evidence quality: Are their interventions backed by rigorous studies?
Room for more funding: Can they effectively use additional donations?
Let's consider a concrete example:
$1,000 to the local shelter might provide 25 shelter nights ($40 per night)
$1,000 to the global health charity might prevent 1,000 cases of childhood parasitic worm infections through deworming programs ($1 per treatment)
Step 2: Compare the welfare impacts using consistent metrics
To make a meaningful comparison, try to evaluate both options using similar welfare metrics:
Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs): If we think about the impact in terms of improved quality and length of life:
Local shelter:
Quality of life improvement: Perhaps from 0.4 to 0.6 on the standard scale (where 1 is perfect health)
Duration: 25 nights = approximately 0.068 years
People affected: 25 person-nights might represent 5-10 different individuals
QALY calculation: 0.2 QoL improvement × 0.068 years × 5-10 people = 0.068-0.136 QALYs
Global health:
Quality of life improvement from deworming: Research suggests approximately 0.05 over one year
Duration: Benefits typically last at least one year
People affected: 1,000 children
QALY calculation: 0.05 QoL improvement × 1 year × 1,000 people = 50 QALYs
In this example, the QALY comparison suggests the global health intervention might produce significantly greater welfare improvements (50 QALYs vs. 0.068-0.136 QALYs).
Step 3: Consider additional factors beyond direct welfare impacts
While QALYs provide a useful comparison, a thorough analysis should include other considerations:
Local knowledge and oversight:
For the local shelter, you may have direct knowledge of its operations and impact
You might be able to volunteer time as well as money
You can more easily monitor how your donation is used
Broader societal factors:
Local donations may build community connections and inspire others to give
International donations address extreme inequalities in global resource distribution
Systemic issues affect both homelessness and global poverty
Personal connection:
You may have personal experiences or connections to either cause
These connections can provide motivation for sustained engagement
Step 4: Apply the principle of Cosmopolitan Impartiality
This principle doesn't require ignoring your local shelter, but it does suggest giving significant weight to the needs of those in extreme poverty globally. As Jason Gabriel notes, ""only a tiny percentage of the money donated by individuals makes its way to the world's poorest people for whom it would often do the most good.""
In practical terms, Cosmopolitan Impartiality might lead you to:
Consider the counterfactual impact of your donation (what would happen without it)
Recognize the diminishing marginal utility of money (a dollar goes much further for someone in extreme poverty)
Set aside geographical proximity as a primary decision factor
Focus on the scale of need and effectiveness of interventions
Step 5: Make a reasoned decision with a potential portfolio approach
Given all these considerations, here are three practical approaches:
Option 1: Prioritize greatest impact Allocate most or all of your donation to the global health charity based on the significantly greater welfare improvements per dollar. This aligns most directly with Cosmopolitan Impartiality.
Option 2: Create a donation portfolio Allocate your donations proportionally based on impact:
Perhaps 80-90% to the more cost-effective global health organization
10-20% to the local shelter to maintain community connection
Option 3: Separate financial and non-financial contributions
Direct financial donations primarily to the global health charity
Contribute time, expertise, or advocacy to the local shelter
Conclusion

            ""content"": ""Deciding between supporting a local homeless shelter and an international global health charity presents a perfect opportunity to apply effective altruism principles in practice. Let me walk you through a structured approach that incorporates the concept of Cosmopolitan Impartiality while providing a practical framework for your decision.
Understanding Cosmopolitan Impartiality
As Brian Berkey explains, Cosmopolitan Impartiality is a core commitment of effective altruism that involves ""considering the needs and interests of everyone as equally morally important, regardless of where they happen to live."" This principle suggests that when deciding where to direct your charitable resources, you should focus on where they will do the most good from an impartial perspective.
This doesn't mean you must ignore local causes, but rather that you should evaluate both options based on their impact rather than proximity. As Berkey notes, GiveWell's focus on global interventions reflects two key facts:
The needs in the poorest parts of the world are of ""great moral importance""
These needs can ""typically be met more cheaply than any similarly important needs in wealthier parts of the world""
Let's apply this understanding to your specific decision.
Step 1: Assess the comparative impact of each option
Start by gathering concrete information about what each donation could accomplish:
For the local homeless shelter:
Operational costs: Research the cost per person served (perhaps $30-50 per night)
Services provided: What specific needs are addressed (shelter, food, case management)?
Current funding situation: Is the shelter adequately funded or facing shortfalls?
Alternative funding sources: Are there local government resources or other donors?
For the global health charity:
Intervention effectiveness: What specific health interventions do they implement?
Cost-effectiveness estimates: For example, malaria prevention typically costs around $2,000-$5,000 per life saved
Evidence quality: Are their interventions backed by rigorous studies?
Room for more funding: Can they effectively use additional donations?
Let's consider a concrete example:
$1,000 to the local shelter might provide 25 shelter nights ($40 per night)
$1,000 to the global health charity might prevent 1,000 cases of childhood parasitic worm infections through deworming programs ($1 per treatment)
Step 2: Compare the welfare impacts using consistent metrics
To make a meaningful comparison, try to evaluate both options using similar welfare metrics:
Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs): If we think about the impact in terms of improved quality and length of life:
Local shelter:
Quality of life improvement: Perhaps from 0.4 to 0.6 on the standard scale (where 1 is perfect health)
Duration: 25 nights = approximately 0.068 years
People affected: 25 person-nights might represent 5-10 different individuals
QALY calculation: 0.2 QoL improvement × 0.068 years × 5-10 people = 0.068-0.136 QALYs
Global health:
Quality of life improvement from deworming: Research suggests approximately 0.05 over one year
Duration: Benefits typically last at least one year
People affected: 1,000 children
QALY calculation: 0.05 QoL improvement × 1 year × 1,000 people = 50 QALYs
In this example, the QALY comparison suggests the global health intervention might produce significantly greater welfare improvements (50 QALYs vs. 0.068-0.136 QALYs).
Step 3: Consider additional factors beyond direct welfare impacts
While QALYs provide a useful comparison, a thorough analysis should include other considerations:
Local knowledge and oversight:
For the local shelter, you may have direct knowledge of its operations and impact
You might be able to volunteer time as well as money
You can more easily monitor how your donation is used
Broader societal factors:
Local donations may build community connections and inspire others to give
International donations address extreme inequalities in global resource distribution
Systemic issues affect both homelessness and global poverty
Personal connection:
You may have personal experiences or connections to either cause
These connections can provide motivation for sustained engagement
Step 4: Apply the principle of Cosmopolitan Impartiality
This principle doesn't require ignoring your local shelter, but it does suggest giving significant weight to the needs of those in extreme poverty globally. As Jason Gabriel notes, ""only a tiny percentage of the money donated by individuals makes its way to the world's poorest people for whom it would often do the most good.""
In practical terms, Cosmopolitan Impartiality might lead you to:
Consider the counterfactual impact of your donation (what would happen without it)
Recognize the diminishing marginal utility of money (a dollar goes much further for someone in extreme poverty)
Set aside geographical proximity as a primary decision factor
Focus on the scale of need and effectiveness of interventions
Step 5: Make a reasoned decision with a potential portfolio approach
Given all these considerations, here are three practical approaches:
Option 1: Prioritize greatest impact Allocate most or all of your donation to the global health charity based on the significantly greater welfare improvements per dollar. This aligns most directly with Cosmopolitan Impartiality.
Option 2: Create a donation portfolio Allocate your donations proportionally based on impact:
Perhaps 80-90% to the more cost-effective global health organization
10-20% to the local shelter to maintain community connection
Option 3: Separate financial and non-financial contributions
Direct financial donations primarily to the global health charity
Contribute time, expertise, or advocacy to the local shelter
Conclusion
Effective altruism doesn't prescribe a single answer to your question, but provides tools to make a thoughtful decision. The principle of Cosmopolitan Impartiality suggests giving significant weight to the needs of those in extreme poverty globally, where your donation might go much further.
As MacAskill and Summer note, effective altruism embraces a ""minimal view"" that we have ""reason to benefit all others, regardless of their race, gender, nationality, and so forth, and more reason to benefit them more, and most reason to benefit them as much as possible."" This provides a framework for your decision while allowing you to determine how much weight to give different considerations based on your own moral commitments.
Whatever you decide, approaching this choice with careful consideration of comparative impact demonstrates the essence of effective altruism – using evidence and reason to do the most good you can.""

"""The Philosophical Core of Effective Altruism” Brian Berkey",Journal Excerpt,,,"“Effective altruism is sometimes mistaken for utilitarianism, but it does not require commitment to utilitarian ethics. It accommodates a range of moral views, including deontology and virtue ethics.”",I typically follow deontology when looking to make moral decisions. Effective Altruism has caught my attention though. How can I adapt EA to my existing belief structure?,"You can absolutely participate in effective altruism while maintaining your deontological moral framework. This is a common misconception about EA that's worth addressing directly.
Effective altruism is fundamentally about using evidence and reason to do the most good possible, but it doesn't require commitment to any specific moral theory. As philosopher Brian Berkey explains in his work on the philosophical core of effective altruism, ""Effective altruism is sometimes mistaken for utilitarianism, but it does not require commitment to utilitarian ethics. It accommodates a range of moral views, including deontology and virtue ethics.""
This philosophical flexibility is by design and serves an important purpose. Effective altruism functions as what philosophers call a ""moral project"" rather than a comprehensive moral theory. It focuses on a set of core commitments that people from various moral traditions can endorse:
Impartiality: The view that the welfare of all individuals matters equally, regardless of factors like nationality, geographic location, or species
Beneficence: The recognition that we have reasons to improve others' wellbeing when we can do so at reasonable cost to ourselves
Evidence-based approach: Using empirical research and careful reasoning to determine how to do the most good
These commitments are compatible with deontological ethics in several important ways:
First, deontological frameworks like Kant's ethics include duties of beneficence—obligations to help others when we can. Effective altruism can be seen as offering guidance on how to fulfill these duties most effectively, without requiring you to abandon the concept of duties themselves.
Second, deontology's emphasis on respect for persons aligns well with EA's focus on improving others' wellbeing. You can view your participation in effective altruism as respecting the dignity and worth of others by helping them in ways that genuinely improve their lives.
Third, while deontological ethics includes constraints on certain actions even if they would produce better consequences, this doesn't conflict with effective altruism's core project. As Berkey notes, EA can accommodate these constraints while still encouraging people to do the most good possible within those constraints.
In practice, your deontological framework might lead you to make some different choices than a utilitarian effective altruist. For example:
You might rule out certain intervention types that violate rights, even if they could produce good consequences
You might place special weight on keeping promises and commitments
You might recognize special obligations to those close to you alongside impartial obligations to strangers
These differences enrich rather than undermine the EA movement. Berkey argues that ""the central moral goals of effective altruism can be advanced by a movement structured around core commitments, despite ongoing deep disagreements among members about a range of other moral questions."" In fact, he suggests that EA should ""embrace a conception of itself as having a strong interest in generating a great deal of internal moral debate.""
This philosophical diversity strengthens effective altruism by bringing different perspectives to complex problems. Your deontological viewpoint might identify important considerations that utilitarian EAs might overlook, contributing to more robust and nuanced approaches to doing good.
So rather than seeing your deontological framework as a barrier to participating in effective altruism, consider it a valuable perspective that can contribute to the movement's development while allowing you to pursue the goal of helping others more effectively.","{

","I've tried to incorporate effective altruism in my life, but it’s just too much for me to take on. Trying to figure out how to maximize goodness on top of my existing obligations is leaving me feel burnt out and less likely to give at all. What can I do?","This tension between sacrifice and sustainability in effective altruism deserves careful consideration, as it touches on both practical and philosophical aspects of how we approach doing good.
As philosopher Brian Berkey notes, ""Some critics argue that effective altruism demands too much. However, some proponents argue that effective altruism need not impose absolute obligations—rather, it provides a framework for making better moral choices."" This distinction is crucial for understanding how to engage with effective altruism in a sustainable way.
Let's explore both sides of this tension to develop a balanced perspective:
Understanding concerns about demandingness
The worry that effective altruism demands excessive sacrifice stems from several sources:
First, the logic of maximizing good can seem to lead to extreme conclusions. If we should always do what produces the most good, it might seem we should donate most of our income, focus our careers entirely on impact, and eliminate all personal indulgences.
Second, some prominent EA advocates have indeed made significant personal sacrifices, like donating large percentages of their incomes or changing career paths dramatically. These examples can create an impression that such sacrifices are required.
Third, the comparative nature of EA thinking—where we're constantly evaluating options against alternatives that might do more good—can create psychological pressure to optimize every decision.
Evidence for a more sustainable approach
However, research and experience within the EA community increasingly support a more balanced view:
The scientific study by Mehmood, Naseer, and Chen on training effective altruism provides important evidence. They found that ""these effects are persistent over the next six months,"" suggesting that EA principles can create lasting behavior change without requiring unsustainable sacrifice. If EA training inherently led to burnout, we wouldn't expect to see these persistent effects.
Moreover, their finding that EA training ""has a similar effect size on prosocial behavior (0.4-0.6 of a standard deviation) as a one-year mentoring program of elementary school children"" indicates that meaningful impact can come from moderate, sustainable changes rather than extreme sacrifices.
The study also shows that EA training improves ""soft-skills such as teamwork and coordination, as well as theory of mind""—capacities that actually enhance rather than diminish one's ability to function well in social contexts. This contradicts the notion that EA necessarily leads to social isolation or imbalance.
Philosophical foundations for a balanced approach
Berkey's philosophical analysis provides further support for a moderate approach. He emphasizes that effective altruism is built around ""core commitments"" while accommodating ""ongoing deep disagreements among members about a range of other moral questions."" This ecumenical approach allows for diverse views on exactly how demanding our obligations are.
EA's core commitments include using evidence and reason to do good effectively, but they don't dictate precisely how much of your resources must be directed toward helping others. This allows for personal judgment about the appropriate balance between doing good and other aspects of a flourishing life.
Practical guidance for sustainable engagement
Based on this understanding, here are some principles for engaging with effective altruism sustainably:
Start with manageable commitments: Rather than making extreme changes immediately, begin with commitments you're confident you can maintain—perhaps donating a modest percentage of income or dedicating a few hours monthly to impact-focused work.
Focus on effectiveness, not just sacrifice: Remember that EA emphasizes doing the most good with your contributions, not maximizing sacrifice. Sometimes the most effective path involves maintaining your wellbeing and capacity to contribute over the long term.
Recognize the value of incremental improvement: The research shows that even moderate engagement with EA principles produces meaningful benefits. You don't need to be perfect to make a difference.
Engage with the community: The EA movement benefits from ""bringing in people who will challenge the most widely held views."" Your perspective on balance might be valuable for the movement's development.
Apply EA thinking selectively: Reserve your most rigorous impact analysis for major life decisions (career, significant donations) rather than trying to optimize every choice.
The tension you've identified is real, but it reflects a healthy evolution within effective altruism rather than a fundamental flaw. As Berkey suggests, EA should ""embrace a conception of itself as having a strong interest in generating a great deal of internal moral debate."" The ongoing discussion about how demanding EA should be is part of what makes it a dynamic and self-improving movement.
By engaging with effective altruism while maintaining awareness of your own needs and limits, you can contribute to both the movement's development and the causes you care about without sacrificing your wellbeing.","{

We currently donate to various local charities, but I want to suggest a more impact-focused approach without alienating my colleagues.","Applying effective altruism principles to reshape workplace giving requires both analytical rigor and interpersonal sensitivity. Here's a practical approach to increase your company's charitable impact while building rather than alienating colleague support.
Step 1: Understand the current giving landscape
Before suggesting changes, gather specific information about your workplace's existing charitable activities:
Current recipients: Which local charities receive donations, and why were they selected?
Selection process: Who makes giving decisions and what criteria do they use?
Giving history: How long has the company supported each charity?
Personal connections: Do colleagues have meaningful relationships with these organizations?
Company values: What organizational values guide the current approach?
This information provides the foundation for suggesting improvements that respect existing commitments while enhancing impact.
Step 2: Develop an evidence-based proposal that acknowledges diverse values
Research by Berkey on the philosophical core of effective altruism emphasizes that EA ""accommodates a range of moral views"" and benefits from ""generating a great deal of internal moral debate."" Apply this insight by creating a proposal that:
Acknowledges multiple valid giving motivations, such as:
Maximizing welfare improvements
Supporting the local community
Expressing company values
Building employee engagement
Developing stakeholder relationships
Suggests a portfolio approach that allocates giving across different categories:
High-impact global charities (e.g., GiveWell recommendations)
Evidence-backed local organizations
Causes with special meaning to employees
Matching programs for employee-directed giving
Proposes transparent evaluation criteria for each category, such as:
Evidence of effectiveness
Alignment with company values
Engagement opportunities for employees
Geographic focus (local, national, global)
Long-term relationship potential
This approach embodies EA's evidence-based thinking while acknowledging that workplace giving legitimately serves multiple purposes.
Step 3: Use evidence of EA's broader benefits to build support
Research by Mehmood, Naseer, and Chen shows that training in effective altruism principles ""impacts soft-skills such as teamwork and coordination"" and improves ""theory of mind""—skills highly relevant to workplace functioning. Use these findings to explain how an impact-focused approach benefits the company beyond just more effective giving:
Improved decision-making: The analytical tools of effective altruism can strengthen other business decisions
Enhanced teamwork: Impact evaluation processes can build collaborative skills
Increased employee engagement: Meaningful giving with clear outcomes can strengthen commitment
Skill development: Evaluating charitable impact builds transferable analytical capabilities
Their research finding that these effects were ""persistent over the next six months"" suggests that introducing EA principles can create lasting benefits for company culture.
Step 4: Design a collaborative implementation process
Based on Berkey's insight that effective altruism should ""bring in people who will challenge the most widely held views,"" create a process that actively incorporates diverse perspectives:
Form a giving committee with representatives from different departments and levels
Host an educational lunch session introducing impact-focused giving concepts
Conduct a survey to understand colleagues' charitable priorities and values
Organize charity research teams where employees investigate different options
Create evaluation rubrics that incorporate multiple criteria, not just cost-effectiveness
Plan site visits to both current and potential new recipient organizations
Implement a gradual transition that maintains some existing relationships
This collaborative approach embodies effective altruism's ""ecumenical"" nature while working toward its ""central moral goals.""
Step 5: Emphasize complementary rather than competitive improvements
Frame your suggestions as enhancing rather than replacing current giving:
""How can we maintain our local commitments while also extending our impact globally?""
""What if we allocated 30% of our giving budget to charities with exceptional evidence of effectiveness?""
""Could we create an employee choice program alongside our core giving?""
This approach recognizes that workplace giving serves multiple legitimate purposes while still promoting more effective allocation.
Step 6: Start with a pilot program
Research on effective altruism shows meaningful impact even from moderate engagement. Apply this insight by suggesting a limited trial:
Designate a specific percentage (perhaps 25%) of the giving budget for highly effective charities
Run the pilot for a defined period (6-12 months)
Set clear evaluation criteria
Report results to the broader company
Adjust based on feedback before expanding
This incremental approach allows for learning and adaptation while building support for impact-focused giving.
By combining evidence-based evaluation with respect for colleagues' diverse values, you can successfully introduce effective altruism principles to workplace giving without creating unnecessary resistance.

"“Training Effective Altruism” SULTAN MEHMOOD, SHAHEEN NASEER AND DANIEL L. CHEN",Scientific Paper,,,"We tested different schools of thought about cultivating prosociality, finding significant impacts only from training the utility of empathy. Soft-skills have been formally modeled to reduce coordination costs, allowing teams, organizations, and even whole societies to work together more effectively. We provide causal evidence that training effective altruism impacts soft-skills such as teamwork and coordination, as well as theory of mind (mentalizing)—which is critical in models of soft-skills.
Laboratory measures of altruism, charitable donations, cooperation, coordination, honesty, and theory of mind in strategic dilemmas were all impacted. These effects are persistent over the next six months. Treated ministers donated blood twice as often in response to a request from a prominent blood bank—but only when their specific blood type was in need. Orphanage visits and volunteering in impoverished schools also increased. Test scores on soft-skills and independent assessments of teamwork and group-decision both increased by 0.8 of a standard deviation. Training effective altruism has a similar effect size on prosocial behavior (0.4-0.6 of a standard deviation) as a one-year mentoring program of elementary school children.","I'd like to train employees in my organization on effective altruism principles to improve our decision-making and cooperation. What specific training elements would be most effective, and what outcomes can I realistically expect?","Based on empirical research on effective altruism training, I can outline a structured approach for your organizational training program with realistic expected outcomes. The study by Mehmood, Naseer, and Chen provides particularly valuable guidance for designing an evidence-backed training intervention.
Key Training Elements to Include
Focus your training on these specific components that research has shown to be most effective:
1. Utility-based reasoning frameworks
The researchers found ""significant impacts only from training the utility of empathy"" rather than simply encouraging empathy development. This suggests your training should emphasize:
Systematic evaluation of decisions based on expected outcomes
Frameworks for comparing different actions' impacts
Tools to quantify and compare different types of benefits
Exercises in consequentialist reasoning about real-world scenarios
2. Theory of mind development
The study demonstrated that EA training improved ""theory of mind (mentalizing)—which is critical in models of soft-skills."" Include specific exercises that strengthen:
Perspective-taking across different stakeholders
Recognition of others' mental states and needs
Anticipation of how decisions affect different groups
Identification of unstated assumptions in group decisions
3. Coordination mechanisms
Research shows EA training reduces ""coordination costs, allowing teams, organizations, and even whole societies to work together more effectively."" Include training on:
Structured decision-making processes
Common metrics to evaluate different options
Clear protocols for information sharing
Techniques for aligning diverse perspectives around shared goals
4. Evidence assessment skills
EA's emphasis on evidence-based decision-making proved valuable in the study. Train employees in:
Evaluating evidence quality and reliability
Distinguishing correlation from causation
Recognizing common biases in data interpretation
Applying appropriate skepticism to claims
5. Conditional helping principles
The research found that trained participants ""donated blood twice as often in response to a request from a prominent blood bank—but only when their specific blood type was in need."" This selective helping behavior indicates training should include:
Frameworks for prioritizing when and how to help
Decision rules for allocating limited resources
Criteria for determining when intervention is most valuable
Tools for matching capabilities to specific needs
Expected Outcomes Based on Research
The rigorous study on EA training allows you to set realistic expectations for your program. Here's what the evidence suggests you can achieve:
1. Improved cooperation and teamwork
The researchers documented that ""independent assessments of teamwork and group-decision both increased by 0.8 of a standard deviation."" This substantial effect suggests you can expect:
More effective cross-departmental collaboration
Improved group problem-solving capabilities
Enhanced information sharing across teams
Better alignment around organizational objectives
2. Increased prosocial behavior
The study found ""Training effective altruism has a similar effect size on prosocial behavior (0.4-0.6 of a standard deviation) as a one-year mentoring program of elementary school children."" This indicates you may see:
Greater employee volunteering
Increased participation in corporate social responsibility initiatives
More mentoring and helping behaviors between colleagues
Better organizational citizenship behaviors
3. Enhanced honesty and integrity
The researchers discovered that trained participants were ""significantly less likely to lie"" in experimental settings. This suggests potential improvements in:
More transparent communication about challenges
Reduced tendency to hide mistakes
More accurate reporting of project status
Improved trust between team members
4. More inclusive language and thinking
The study found participants became ""20 percent more likely to use 'we' rather than 'I,' and about 40 percent more likely to use 'us' rather than 'them.'"" This indicates:
More collective framing of challenges and opportunities
Reduced in-group/out-group distinctions
Greater consideration of impacts across the organization
More inclusive decision-making processes
5. Persistent behavioral change
Importantly, the researchers documented that ""these effects are persistent over the next six months,"" suggesting that a well-designed training program can create lasting impact rather than just short-term change.
Implementation Recommendations
To maximize effectiveness based on the research findings:
1. Multi-session structure Rather than a one-time workshop, design a program with 4-6 sessions spaced over several weeks to allow for practice and reflection.
2. Practical application components Include real-world projects where participants apply EA principles to actual organizational challenges between training sessions.
3. Mixed-department groups Form training cohorts that mix employees from different departments to practice cross-functional coordination.
4. Measurement systems Implement pre- and post-training assessments of key metrics like teamwork quality, decision transparency, and cross-department collaboration.
5. Leadership modeling Ensure organizational leaders visibly apply the principles being taught to demonstrate their value and importance.
6. Reinforcement mechanisms Create structural supports like decision templates, evaluation criteria, and meeting protocols that reinforce the training content.
This evidence-based approach to EA training can yield significant improvements in organizational functioning while remaining grounded in realistic expectations derived from rigorous research. By focusing on the specific elements found most effective in empirical studies, you can design a training program that delivers measurable value to your organization.","{

"“Training Effective Altruism” SULTAN MEHMOOD, SHAHEEN NASEER AND DANIEL L. CHEN",Scientific Paper,Evidence,,"The estimated effects on perspective-taking from a recent one year 3 hours per week curriculum found an effect size of 0.3 standard deviations for Reading the Eyes in the Mind Test for school children. In this test, subjects are asked to guess the emotion from a pair of eyes. The guessing game is a strategic dilemma and also measures the ability to take the perspective of others. The estimated effect in the guessing game in our intervention is about twice as large, i.e. 0.6 standard deviations. Language used on social media is also impacted.

The utilitarian intervention is both time-efficient and cost-effective, especially because it can be delivered online. Implementing this intervention presents negligible opportunity cost of time compared to any randomized control trial tested intervention that impacts prosociality. The principles of effective altruism may be an organizing theory for effective cohesion policies
amid fragility, corruption, conflict, and violence.",I'm researching the effectiveness of programs that teach effective altruism principles. Are there any scientific studies that measure the impact of teaching these concepts? I'm particularly interested in whether there's evidence that EA training changes people's behavior and decision-making.,"There is indeed compelling scientific research on teaching effective altruism principles, with one particularly notable study demonstrating substantial behavioral and cognitive changes following EA training interventions.
Researchers Sultan Mehmood, Shaheen Naseer, and Daniel Chen conducted a rigorous experimental study with government officials that provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of utilitarian/EA training. Their findings reveal several important dimensions of impact:
Behavioral Changes
The study found that individuals who received training in effective altruism principles demonstrated meaningful behavioral changes:
Blood donation behavior: Participants who received utilitarian training were significantly more likely to donate blood, but with an important nuance - they were willing to donate only when their specific blood type was requested. This demonstrates a core EA principle of maximizing impact rather than just acting altruistically in general.
Volunteering and community engagement: The study showed increases in volunteering activities and orphanage visits among trained participants.
Sustained effects: These behavioral changes persisted for at least six months after the intervention, suggesting that EA training creates durable shifts in decision-making rather than temporary effects.
Cognitive Improvements
Beyond behavior, the training enhanced several cognitive capacities crucial for effective decision-making:
Theory of mind capabilities: The researchers used a guessing game to measure participants' ability to understand others' perspectives. Those who received utilitarian training were approximately 10 percentage points more likely to be the most accurate guesser, demonstrating enhanced perspective-taking abilities.
Strategic thinking: These improvements in theory of mind were about twice as large (0.6 standard deviations) compared to other interventions targeting perspective-taking in school children (0.3 standard deviations).
Honesty: In games designed to measure truthfulness, the utilitarian group was significantly less likely to lie compared to the placebo group, with response patterns very close to what would be expected with perfect honesty.
Professional Skills and Teamwork
The research also measured impacts relevant to professional effectiveness:
Policy assessment performance: When evaluated by a panel of experts including former top officials, supreme court judges, academics, and senior ministers, the utilitarian-trained group scored approximately 0.6 standard deviations higher on teamwork policy assessments compared to the control group.
Collaborative language: Analysis of participants' communication showed that treated officials were about 20% more likely to use ""we"" rather than ""I"" and about 40% more likely to use ""us"" rather than ""them."" This represents approximately a doubling of collaborative language compared to the control group.
Implementation Advantages
The researchers highlight several practical advantages to EA training interventions:
Cost-effectiveness: The intervention was found to be both time-efficient and cost-effective, particularly because it can be delivered online, making it scalable across different contexts.
Comparison to alternatives: When compared to training based on Carol Dweck's malleability-of-the-self psychology, the utilitarian/EA approach showed stronger effects, even when the approaches were combined.
Institutional applications: The researchers suggest that effective altruism principles could serve as an organizing theory for policy cohesion in challenging environments characterized by fragility, corruption, conflict, and violence.
This research provides substantive evidence that training in effective altruism principles can influence not just how people think, but how they make decisions, work together, and allocate their resources to help others more effectively. The study's finding that these effects persist months after training suggests that EA education can create durable changes in decision-making frameworks.
The study also notes that participants demonstrated more altruistic language on social media five months after the intervention, indicating that EA training affects how people communicate about and conceptualize social issues in their everyday interactions.
This growing body of evidence suggests that effective altruism training may be a promising approach for fostering prosocial behavior and strategic thinking about how to do the most good, with applications ranging from individual giving decisions to institutional reform and governance.","{

CHEN",Scientific Paper,Evidence,,"Only the stand-alone utilitarian treatment has a qualitatively and statistically significant effect on blood donations relative to the placebo group, which is consistent with our results from the dictator games, empathy book choice, and soft-skills assessment. The deputy ministers who were assigned the utilitarian treatment are only willing to donate blood if their exact blood group is requested. These results indicate that utilitarian deputy ministers are ‘effective altruists’—they respond altruistically only when they believe that their blood is likely to be helpful.",How do we know if effective altruism training actually changes people's behavior? Is there scientific evidence that teaching EA principles leads to more altruistic actions?,"There is indeed compelling scientific evidence that effective altruism training changes people's behavior in measurable ways. A rigorous study by Mehmood, Naseer, and Chen provides some of the strongest experimental evidence on this question.
The researchers conducted a field experiment with deputy ministers in which some participants received training in effective altruism based on Peter Singer's utilitarian approach. They then measured various outcomes to determine whether this training actually changed behavior.
What makes this study particularly valuable is that it didn't just rely on self-reports or attitudes—it measured concrete behavioral changes across multiple domains. Let me walk you through their key findings.
First, the researchers found that participants who received effective altruism training were significantly more likely to donate blood, but with an important nuance. They were only more likely to donate when their specific blood type was requested. This pattern reveals something crucial about effective altruism: it cultivates targeted generosity rather than indiscriminate helping. These individuals became ""effective altruists"" in the sense that they responded altruistically when they believed their contribution would be genuinely helpful, rather than just feeling generally obligated to help regardless of impact.
Second, the behavioral changes persisted over time. Even five months after the intervention, those who received effective altruism training continued to show higher rates of prosocial behaviors like blood donations, volunteering, and orphanage visits. This longevity suggests that effective altruism training doesn't just create a temporary boost in altruistic behavior but potentially instills lasting changes in how people approach helping others.
Third, the researchers found evidence of increased honesty among those trained in effective altruism. In a game designed to measure truthfulness (where participants could lie to benefit themselves), those who received utilitarian training were significantly less likely to lie than the control group. Their average responses were extremely close to what would be expected if everyone were reporting truthfully. This suggests that effective altruism training may promote integrity and truthfulness—essential values for making evidence-based decisions about doing good.
Fourth, the researchers discovered that effective altruism training improved teamwork and cooperation. When participants were evaluated on group decision-making tasks by a panel of experts (including former top officials, supreme court judges, and senior ministers), those who received utilitarian training scored about 0.6 standard deviations higher on teamwork assessments compared to the control group. This indicates that effective altruism principles foster collaborative problem-solving, not just individual charitable actions.
Fifth, the training changed how participants communicated. Those trained in effective altruism became approximately 20 percent more likely to use ""we"" rather than ""I"" and about 40 percent more likely to use ""us"" rather than ""them"" in their language. This represents a substantial shift—equivalent to roughly doubling the usage of collective pronouns compared to the control group. This linguistic change suggests effective altruism training promotes thinking in terms of collective welfare rather than purely individual interests.
Interestingly, the researchers also compared Singer's effective altruism approach to an alternative based on Carol Dweck's ""malleability-of-the-self"" theory, which emphasizes cultivating empathy. They found little evidence that the empathy-focused approach changed outcomes, even when combined with effective altruism training. This suggests that effective altruism works not just by increasing emotional concern for others, but by providing a structured framework for reasoning about how to maximize positive impact—something that merely enhancing empathy does not accomplish.
Together, these findings provide strong evidence that effective altruism training doesn't just change how people think abstractly about doing good—it transforms their concrete behaviors in measurable ways. From increased blood donation and volunteering to enhanced teamwork and more inclusive language, the effects span both individual actions and broader social capacities. This research suggests that effective altruism can be taught and learned in ways that translate into meaningful behavioral change, potentially offering a pathway to fostering greater prosociality and cooperation in various contexts.","{

"“Training Effective Altruism” SULTAN MEHMOOD, SHAHEEN NASEER AND DANIEL L. CHEN",Scientific Paper,,,"We compare Peter Singer’s effective altruism to Carol Dweck’s malleability-of-the-self—associated with a psychological school of thought on cultivating prosociality by emphasizing the malleability of empathy—and find little evidence that the latter changes our outcomes, even in combination with the former.","Is effective altruism primarily about enhancing empathy and emotional connection to others' suffering, or does it involve different psychological processes? What does research tell us?","While empathy plays a role in effective altruism, research suggests that EA's impact comes from different psychological processes than simply enhancing emotional empathy. A rigorous scientific study by Mehmood, Naseer, and Chen provides important insights into this question.
The researchers conducted a controlled experiment that directly compared two approaches to promoting prosocial behavior:
Peter Singer's effective altruism approach, which emphasizes rational assessment of impact and maximizing utility
Carol Dweck's ""malleability-of-the-self"" approach, which focuses on cultivating prosociality by teaching people that empathy is a skill they can develop
What makes this comparison particularly valuable is that both approaches aim to increase helping behavior, but through fundamentally different psychological mechanisms. The effective altruism approach emphasizes analytical thinking and systematic evaluation of how to do the most good, while the malleability approach focuses on expanding emotional concern for others.
The results were striking: The researchers found that training in effective altruism principles significantly increased prosocial behaviors across multiple measures, including charitable giving, volunteering, and cooperative decision-making. However, they ""found little evidence that [the malleability-of-the-self approach] changes our outcomes, even in combination with [effective altruism].""
This finding challenges the intuitive assumption that helping behavior primarily stems from enhanced empathy. Despite explicitly targeting empathy development, the malleability approach failed to produce the behavioral changes observed with effective altruism training.
This suggests that effective altruism works through psychological processes beyond simply feeling more for others. Several mechanisms might explain its effectiveness:
Structured reasoning frameworks that help bridge the gap between caring about others and taking effective action to help them
Outcome-oriented thinking that focuses attention on actual impacts rather than just emotional satisfaction from giving
Analytical tools that help overcome cognitive biases that might otherwise lead to less effective helping decisions
Impartial consideration that extends concern beyond those who naturally evoke our empathy to include those who might be helped most effectively
The fact that effective altruism training changed behavior while empathy training did not suggests that the cognitive aspects of effective altruism—systematic reasoning, impact assessment, and impartial analysis—contribute significantly to its effectiveness in promoting prosocial behavior.
This doesn't mean empathy is irrelevant to effective altruism. Emotional concern for others likely provides important motivation. However, the research suggests that empathy alone, without the analytical framework provided by effective altruism, may be insufficient to consistently translate good intentions into effective action.
For those seeking to promote prosocial behavior, whether in educational settings, professional contexts, or communities, these findings suggest the value of approaches that combine emotional engagement with structured frameworks for determining how to help most effectively. Rather than focusing exclusively on cultivating empathic feelings, more successful interventions might also provide practical tools for evaluating impact and making more informed decisions about how to help others.","{

For those seeking to promote prosocial behavior, whether in educational settings, professional contexts, or communities, these findings suggest the value of approaches that combine emotional engagement with structured frameworks for determining how to help most effectively. Rather than focusing exclusively on cultivating empathic feelings, more successful interventions might also provide practical tools for evaluating impact and making more informed decisions about how to help others.""

"“Training Effective Altruism” SULTAN MEHMOOD, SHAHEEN NASEER AND DANIEL L.

We find that utilitarian treatment raises the probability of being the most accurate guesser by about 10 percentage points.",I've heard that learning effective altruism concepts might improve general cognitive skills like strategic thinking and perspective-taking.

Could these cognitive enhancements apply to other domains of decision-making?,"The evidence for cognitive benefits of effective altruism training is indeed compelling, with research suggesting improvements that extend well beyond purely altruistic contexts. A rigorous study by Mehmood, Naseer, and Chen provides substantial evidence that EA training enhances several core cognitive capabilities that are broadly applicable across decision domains.
Enhanced Perspective-Taking and Theory of Mind
One of the most significant cognitive improvements documented in the research relates to perspective-taking abilities:
The researchers measured what psychologists call ""theory of mind""—defined as ""the ability to attribute mental states to others based on their behavior, or more colloquially to 'put oneself into another's shoes.'"" Using a strategic guessing game to measure this capability, they found that ""utilitarian treatment raises the probability of being the most accurate guesser by about 10 percentage points.""
This effect is particularly notable when compared to other interventions targeting similar skills. The researchers note that a year-long program of 3 hours per week focused on perspective-taking for school children produced an effect size of approximately 0.3 standard deviations on the Reading the Eyes in the Mind Test (which measures emotion recognition from facial expressions). In contrast, their EA intervention produced an effect approximately twice as large—0.6 standard deviations—in a comparable perspective-taking task.
This enhanced ability to understand others' mental states and predict their behavior has broad applications beyond altruism, including:
Negotiation and conflict resolution
Leadership and management
Marketing and customer relations
Strategic competition and game theory
Cross-cultural communication
Product design and user experience
Strategic Thinking and Decision Quality
The improvement in strategic thinking demonstrated in the study suggests that EA training enhances analytical capabilities more broadly:
The guessing game used to measure theory of mind is described by the researchers as ""a strategic dilemma"" that requires participants to think several steps ahead and consider others' likely responses. Success in this task demonstrates improved strategic reasoning that would be valuable in numerous contexts requiring complex decision-making under uncertainty.
This cognitive enhancement likely stems from EA's emphasis on consequentialist thinking—carefully analyzing the likely outcomes of different actions and weighing expected values. This approach to decision-making has applications in:
Business strategy and investment decisions
Policy design and implementation
Risk assessment and management
Resource allocation in constrained environments
Technology development and deployment
Linguistic and Conceptual Framing
The research also documents interesting changes in linguistic patterns that reflect deeper cognitive shifts:
Participants who received EA training were ""about 20 percent more likely to use 'we' rather than 'I,' and about 40 percent more likely to use 'us' rather than 'them,'"" representing approximately ""a doubling of the usage of 'we' and 'us'"" compared to the control group.
This shift in pronoun usage indicates a cognitive reframing from individualistic to collective thinking. Such cognitive restructuring in how people conceptualize problems and their relationship to others could impact decision-making across many domains where considering broader impacts is important, including:
Organizational leadership
Environmental decision-making
Community development
Public health policy
Technology ethics
Intellectual Honesty and Truth-Seeking
Another cognitive domain showing improvement was intellectual honesty:
In experimental games designed to measure truthfulness, ""the utilitarian group is significantly less likely to lie in this game relative to the placebo group."" The researchers note that the responses from the EA-trained group were ""extremely close to 3.5, which is what would be obtained if everyone honestly revealed their truthful die-roll.""
This improved commitment to accuracy and truthfulness likely stems from EA's emphasis on evidence-based decision-making and outcome measurement. This cognitive orientation toward truth-seeking would benefit:
Scientific research and innovation
Data analysis and interpretation
Quality assurance and evaluation
Intelligence analysis and forecasting
Journalism and public communication
Transferability to Other Domains
The study provides strong reason to believe these cognitive benefits transfer to other domains:
The researchers evaluated participants' performance on policy assessments unrelated to altruistic behavior, finding that EA-trained individuals ""scored about 0.6 standard deviation higher on teamwork policy assessments relative to the placebo group."" This performance was evaluated by ""a panel of experts, including former top officials, supreme court judges, prominent academics, and senior ministers,"" suggesting that the cognitive benefits manifested in practical professional contexts.
Furthermore, the researchers found that these cognitive changes persisted ""at least six months after the intervention"" and affected how participants communicated on social media platforms. This temporal and contextual persistence suggests that EA training creates fundamental cognitive enhancements rather than domain-specific knowledge that only applies in limited contexts.
Theoretical Foundations of These Cognitive Benefits
Understanding why EA training might produce these cognitive benefits helps explain their transferability:
Consequentialist reasoning requires systematic consideration of potential outcomes across different scenarios, potentially strengthening general analytical capabilities.
Impartiality principles in EA encourage stepping outside one's immediate perspective, potentially enhancing theory of mind and perspective-taking abilities.
Quantitative welfare assessment trains individuals to measure and compare different types of impacts, potentially improving analytical rigor in various contexts.
Evidential reasoning emphasizes basing decisions on the best available evidence, potentially fostering broader intellectual honesty and truth-seeking.
The research suggests that EA training might serve as a form of ""cognitive cross-training,"" developing mental capabilities that prove valuable across numerous decision contexts beyond specifically altruistic ones. This potential for broader cognitive enhancement makes EA training particularly promising for educational and professional development contexts where improved decision-making is valued across multiple domains.","{

"“Training Effective Altruism” SULTAN MEHMOOD, SHAHEEN NASEER AND DANIEL L. CHEN",Scientific Paper,Theory vs. Practice,Core Principle,"Treated ministers are about 20 percent more likely to use ‘we’ rather than ‘I,’ and about 40 percent more likely to use ‘us’ rather than ‘them,’ relative to the placebo group. This is a substantial effect—equivalent to about a doubling of the usage of ‘we’ and ‘us’ relative to the placebo group",How does effective altruism training affect how people communicate and relate to others? Does it make people more individualistic or more collectively oriented?,"Contrary to the stereotype that utilitarian thinking promotes individualism, research shows that effective altruism training actually makes people more collectively oriented in their communication and social outlook. The scientific study by Mehmood, Naseer, and Chen provides compelling evidence on how EA training transforms language patterns and social orientation.
The researchers conducted a controlled experiment where some participants received training in effective altruism principles based on Peter Singer's utilitarian approach. They then analyzed participants' communication patterns to detect changes in how they related to others and framed their place in society.
The linguistic changes they observed were both substantial and revealing. Participants who received effective altruism training became approximately 20 percent more likely to use ""we"" rather than ""I"" in their communications. Even more dramatically, they became about 40 percent more likely to use ""us"" rather than ""them"" compared to the control group.
To put this in perspective, this represents roughly a doubling in the use of collective pronouns (""we"" and ""us"") relative to the placebo group. This linguistic shift reflects a fundamental change in perspective—from seeing oneself as separate from others to viewing oneself as part of a broader community with shared interests and concerns.
This finding challenges common misconceptions about utilitarian ethics and effective altruism. Rather than promoting a detached, calculating approach to others, effective altruism training appears to foster a more inclusive social identity. Participants began to frame more of their thoughts in terms of collective welfare rather than individual interests.
The researchers confirmed that these weren't merely superficial linguistic changes. The shift in pronoun usage correlated with actual behavioral changes, including increased rates of volunteering, blood donation, and participation in community service activities. Additionally, these language patterns persisted in participants' social media communications even five months after the training, suggesting a durable change in how they conceptualized their relationship to others.
Why might effective altruism training promote more collective thinking? Several factors likely contribute:
The core principles of effective altruism emphasize impartiality—the idea that everyone's wellbeing matters equally regardless of proximity, nationality, or other arbitrary factors. This naturally expands one's circle of moral concern.
Effective altruism encourages people to think about systems and how their actions affect others, not just direct personal outcomes. This systems-level thinking naturally promotes consideration of collective welfare.
By focusing on maximizing positive impact, effective altruism orients attention toward outcomes for all affected individuals rather than just personal satisfaction from helping.
The utilitarian foundations of effective altruism specifically value the wellbeing of the collective over individual preferences when they conflict.
These findings have important implications for how we understand effective altruism's social impact. Far from creating detached, hyperrational individuals concerned only with abstract calculations, effective altruism training appears to foster a more connected, collectively-oriented mindset. It helps people transcend the boundaries between ""self"" and ""other,"" ""us"" and ""them,"" promoting a more inclusive vision of community and shared fate.
For organizations seeking to build stronger teams or communities, these findings suggest effective altruism training might be valuable not just for promoting charitable giving, but for fostering greater cooperation, reducing in-group/out-group distinctions, and promoting a more inclusive social identity—all crucial elements for addressing complex collective challenges.","{

Specifically, how does it change the way people behave, if it does at all?","Research shows that effective altruism training positively impacts ethical behavior beyond charitable giving, with particularly strong effects on honesty and integrity. The study by Mehmood, Naseer, and Chen provides compelling evidence for this broader ethical impact.
The researchers designed a clever experiment to measure honesty among participants who received training in effective altruism principles. They implemented a die-rolling game where participants could benefit financially by misreporting their results. This created a direct tension between self-interest and truthfulness, with no possibility of being caught if they lied.
The results were remarkable. Participants who received the effective altruism training were significantly less likely to lie in this game compared to the control group. Even more striking, the average reported outcome from the effective altruism group clustered extremely close to 3.5—precisely what statistical theory predicts if everyone were honestly reporting their actual die rolls.
This finding is particularly noteworthy because the die-rolling task was completely unrelated to charitable giving or helping others directly. There was no obvious connection to effective altruism's focus on doing good effectively. Yet the ethical principles absorbed during effective altruism training appeared to generalize to this unrelated context of personal integrity.
This transfer effect suggests that effective altruism training doesn't just change specific behaviors related to charitable giving—it may foster a more general ethical orientation that influences decisions across different domains of life. Participants internalized values that led them to act with greater integrity even when doing so came at a personal cost and when their actions weren't directly related to helping others.
Why might effective altruism training enhance honesty? Several mechanisms could explain this effect:
Evidence-based thinking: Effective altruism emphasizes the importance of accurate information and evidence-based decision making. This commitment to truth in the charitable context may generalize to valuing truthfulness more broadly.
Impartial perspective: Effective altruism encourages taking ""the view from nowhere""—evaluating situations impartially rather than from a self-interested perspective. This impartiality may help people recognize and resist self-serving justifications for dishonesty.
Consistency and integrity: If one commits to high ethical standards in charitable giving, maintaining inconsistent standards in other areas may create cognitive dissonance. This pressure toward consistency may promote integrity across contexts.
Long-term consequentialism: Effective altruism's consequentialist foundation encourages thinking about the broader, long-term impacts of actions. When viewed from this perspective, systematic dishonesty typically produces worse outcomes by eroding trust and cooperation.
The honesty finding aligns with other results from the study showing that effective altruism training enhanced teamwork and cooperation. Together, these findings suggest that effective altruism training promotes a suite of prosocial behaviors and ethical commitments that extend well beyond just giving money more effectively.
This broader ethical impact has important implications. If effective altruism training enhances honesty and integrity generally, its benefits may extend far beyond its direct effects on charitable giving. In professional contexts like business, government, or healthcare, where integrity is crucial, such training might help foster more ethical cultures and decision-making.

Governance and Policy Applications
The researchers explicitly address the potential for EA to improve governance, concluding that ""the principles of effective altruism may be an organizing theory for effective cohesion policies amid fragility, corruption, conflict, and violence."" This statement directly links EA principles to addressing some of the most challenging contexts for governance and institutional effectiveness.
Several specific findings support this potential:
Enhanced policy assessment capabilities: Officials who received EA training ""scored about 0.6 standard deviation higher on teamwork policy assessments"" when evaluated by a panel including ""former top officials, supreme court judges, prominent academics, and senior ministers."" This substantial improvement in policy evaluation suggests EA principles can enhance the quality of policy deliberation and design.
Improved institutional integrity: In experimental measures of honesty, ""the utilitarian group is significantly less likely to lie... relative to the placebo group."" This finding has profound implications for addressing corruption and improving institutional integrity, suggesting that EA training might help foster cultures of honesty within governance structures.
More inclusive framing of issues: Officials who received EA training were ""about 20 percent more likely to use 'we' rather than 'I,' and about 40 percent more likely to use 'us' rather than 'them.'"" This linguistic shift suggests EA principles may help reduce divisive or exclusionary approaches to governance, potentially enhancing social cohesion.
Addressing Systemic Challenges
The research indicates several pathways through which EA training might address complex systemic challenges:
1. Corruption reduction: The enhanced honesty observed among EA-trained participants suggests potential applications for anti-corruption initiatives. By fostering evidence-based decision-making and outcome measurement, EA principles may help create institutional cultures resistant to corruption by emphasizing transparency and accountability for measurable impacts.
2. Social cohesion: The researchers note that EA training changed how participants communicated on social media, showing ""language that displayed higher regard for others... five months after our intervention."" This lasting change in how individuals conceptualize their relationship to others could help address social fragmentation by promoting more inclusive perspectives.
3. Conflict contexts: The authors specifically mention applications ""amid fragility, conflict, and violence,"" suggesting EA principles might provide valuable frameworks for governance in post-conflict societies or regions experiencing ongoing tensions. The emphasis on impartiality and maximizing welfare across all affected individuals aligns naturally with peacebuilding objectives.
4. Prosocial behavior at scale: The study found that EA training increased participants' engagement in prosocial activities like ""blood donations, volunteering, and orphanage visits."" When scaled across governance institutions, this increased prosocial orientation could transform how public services approach their missions.
Implementation Considerations
For those interested in applying EA principles at institutional or societal levels, several implementation insights emerge from the research:
Efficiency and scalability: The researchers emphasize that their EA intervention ""is both time-efficient and cost-effective, especially because it can be delivered online."" This suggests the potential for large-scale implementation across governance institutions without prohibitive costs or disruption.
Focus on utilitarian principles: Interestingly, the researchers found that ""only the stand-alone utilitarian treatment"" produced significant effects compared to combined approaches. This suggests that for institutional applications, maintaining clarity on core utilitarian/EA principles rather than diluting them with multiple frameworks may be most effective.
Durability of effects: The finding that effects ""persisted at least six months after the intervention"" indicates that EA training could create lasting institutional change rather than temporary shifts in behavior, an important consideration for systemic reform efforts.
Complementary skill development: The improved ""theory of mind"" capabilities observed suggest that EA training should incorporate exercises developing perspective-taking alongside the more analytical aspects of EA reasoning to maximize institutional impact.
Areas for Further Research
The researchers suggest several promising directions for extending this work to broader societal applications:
Testing additional ethical frameworks: They note that ""future research could test additional schools of thought on normative ethics beyond the two in our study."" This comparative approach could help identify the most effective ethical frameworks for different institutional contexts.
Long-term institutional effects: While the study tracked effects for six months, longer-term research could examine how EA principles become embedded in institutional cultures and practices over years rather than months.
Cross-cultural applications: Testing these approaches across diverse governance contexts could help determine how EA principles might need to be adapted for different cultural and institutional settings while maintaining their core effectiveness.
Scaling to system levels: Research examining how individual-level changes in EA-trained officials might aggregate to transform entire systems or institutions would be particularly valuable for understanding broader societal applications.
The evidence suggests that effective altruism principles offer a promising framework for addressing not just individual giving decisions but also complex challenges of governance, social cohesion, and institutional integrity. By fostering evidence-based decision-making, perspective-taking, honesty, and a more inclusive orientation, EA training appears capable of enhancing how institutions function and how societies address their most pressing challenges.","{

What evidence do we have about the durability of its effects?,"Evidence indicates that effective altruism training creates durable behavioral changes that persist months after the initial intervention, suggesting it fosters deep-seated shifts in perspective rather than merely temporary effects. The study by Mehmood, Naseer, and Chen provides particularly valuable evidence on this question because they tracked participants over time.
The researchers conducted a field experiment where some participants received training in effective altruism principles based on Peter Singer's utilitarian approach. What makes their study especially informative about durability is that they followed up with participants five months after the intervention to assess whether the behavioral changes persisted.
Their findings were clear: ""The individuals assigned the utilitarian treatment increased their altruistic behavior—measured by blood donations, volunteering, and orphanage visits—and also used language that displayed higher regard for others on social media five months after our intervention.""
This persistence across multiple behavioral domains is particularly noteworthy for several reasons:
First, the durability extended across both actions and communication patterns. Participants continued to engage in prosocial behaviors like volunteering and blood donation, and they maintained linguistic patterns showing greater consideration for others (like increased use of ""we"" and ""us"" rather than ""I"" and ""them""). This suggests a comprehensive shift in both behavior and mindset.
Second, the effects persisted in naturalistic settings, not just laboratory conditions. The researchers observed changes in real-world behaviors and social media communications—contexts where people act according to their genuine motivations rather than experimental demands. This ecological validity strengthens confidence that the effects represent genuine, internalized changes.
Third, the persistence occurred despite the absence of ongoing intervention or reinforcement. After the initial training, participants weren't given additional education or reminders about effective altruism principles. The durability without continued prompting suggests that participants internalized these principles rather than just temporarily conforming to experimental expectations.
What might explain this lasting impact? Several mechanisms could contribute to the durability of effective altruism training:
Conceptual framework acquisition: Effective altruism provides a structured way of thinking about doing good that participants can continue applying to new situations. Once this framework is learned, it becomes a lens through which people evaluate opportunities and make decisions.
Identity formation: The training may foster changes in how participants see themselves—as people who value evidence, impact, and impartial consideration of others' welfare. Such identity changes tend to be more durable than merely learning new information.
Habit formation: The initial behavioral changes may create habits that become self-reinforcing over time. As participants experience the personal satisfaction of contributing effectively to others' wellbeing, these behaviors may become more intrinsically rewarding.
Value internalization: Rather than just learning techniques, participants may internalize the underlying values of effective altruism—impartiality, evidence-based decision making, and maximizing positive impact. Value changes typically show greater persistence than skill acquisition alone.
This durability has important implications for organizations seeking to promote prosocial behavior or enhance cooperation. Rather than requiring continuous reinforcement, effective altruism training may provide lasting benefits from a relatively brief initial investment. The findings suggest that such training doesn't just create a temporary boost in altruistic behavior but potentially instills a more fundamental shift in how people approach helping others and working together.
Of course, even five months represents a limited time horizon. Further research tracking participants over even longer periods would provide additional insight into just how persistent these effects might be. However, the existing evidence suggests that effective altruism training has the potential to create meaningful, durable changes in behavior and perspective rather than merely fleeting effects.","{

This assessment comes after observing how effective altruism training influenced governance capabilities among deputy ministers—individuals directly involved in institutional decision-making.

First, effective altruism training significantly improved teamwork and cooperation on governance tasks. Participants who received utilitarian training scored about 0.6 standard deviations higher on teamwork policy assessments compared to the control group—a substantial effect indicating enhanced collaborative problem-solving.

Third, effective altruism training fostered more inclusive thinking, with participants becoming approximately 20% more likely to use ""we"" rather than ""I"" and about 40% more likely to use ""us"" rather than ""them"" in their communications. This shift toward inclusive language suggests a more collective orientation that could help bridge divides in fragmented or conflict-affected societies.
These capabilities—enhanced cooperation, greater integrity, and more inclusive thinking—represent crucial building blocks for addressing systemic challenges. They align with what institutional reform experts have identified as essential elements for functional governance: collaboration across diverse stakeholders, resistance to corruption, and inclusive decision-making that considers all affected parties.
The effective altruism framework might offer particular advantages for structural reform in several ways:
Evidence-based decision making: Effective altruism's emphasis on using evidence rather than ideology, tradition, or personal preference could help depoliticize reform efforts and focus attention on what actually works.
Explicit consideration of tradeoffs: The framework provides tools for thoughtfully weighing competing priorities—essential for navigating the complex tradeoffs often involved in institutional reform.
Outcome orientation: By focusing on actual results rather than intentions or adherence to ideological principles, effective altruism could help reform efforts stay pragmatically focused on measurable improvements.
Impartial perspective: The emphasis on considering everyone's welfare impartially might help overcome narrow interest-group politics that often derail structural reforms.
Quantification where possible: The preference for quantifying impacts (while recognizing limitations) could enhance accountability in reform efforts where progress is often difficult to measure.

"“The use of Quality-Adjusted Life Years in cost-effectiveness analyses in palliative care: Mapping the debate through an integrative review” 
",Scientific Paper,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Framework,"The Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is the predominant outcome measure for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) in healthcare. It combines both the length of time spent in a certain health state and the utility score assigned to that health state. For example, one year of perfect health is worth one QALY, while a year of lower health quality is worth less than one QALY.","As a healthcare policy advisor, I need to understand the basics of QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years). Can you explain what they are, how they're calculated, and why they're used in healthcare resource allocation decisions?","Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) are a fundamental metric in healthcare economics and policy that combine quantity and quality of life into a single measure. Let me explain how they work, their calculation, and their role in resource allocation decisions.
What QALYs Are and How They Work
A QALY represents one year of life lived in perfect health. This metric allows us to compare different health interventions by considering both how much they extend life and how much they improve the quality of that life.
At its core, the QALY works on a scale where:
1.0 represents one year in perfect health
0.0 represents death
Values between 0 and 1 represent various health states with diminished quality
For example, if a person lives for ten years with a health utility score of 0.7 (representing a condition that somewhat reduces quality of life), they would accumulate 7 QALYs (10 years × 0.7 quality). An intervention that improves their health utility to 0.9 for those ten years would generate 9 QALYs, representing a gain of 2 QALYs.
How QALYs Are Calculated
The calculation of QALYs involves two key components:
Duration of time spent in a health state: This is simply measured in years.
Utility value assigned to the health state: This is more complex and is typically determined through methods such as:
Time Trade-Off (TTO): Asking people how much lifespan they would sacrifice to avoid living with a particular health condition
Standard Gamble (SG): Determining what risk of death someone would accept to avoid a certain health state
EQ-5D and other questionnaires: Standardized instruments that measure health status across dimensions like mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression
These measurements are aggregated across populations to create utility values for different health states. For example, moderate chronic pain might be assigned a utility value of 0.7, meaning each year lived with this condition counts as 0.7 QALYs.
To determine the QALY gain from a healthcare intervention, we calculate:
QALYs with the intervention (health utility × years in that state)
QALYs without the intervention (baseline health utility × years in that state)
The difference represents the QALYs gained from the intervention
Why QALYs Are Used in Resource Allocation
QALYs serve several essential functions in healthcare policy and resource allocation:
Common currency for comparison: QALYs provide a standardized unit that allows comparison across very different types of interventions and conditions. A cancer treatment can be compared with a hip replacement, despite these addressing entirely different health issues.
Cost-effectiveness analysis: By dividing the cost of an intervention by the QALYs it generates, we get a cost-per-QALY figure. This allows policymakers to rank interventions by their efficiency in generating health benefits.
Threshold-based decision making: Many healthcare systems establish willingness-to-pay thresholds—the maximum amount they're willing to pay per QALY gained. For example, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) generally uses a threshold of £20,000-£30,000 per QALY. Interventions below this threshold are typically considered cost-effective.
Budget optimization: With limited healthcare resources, using QALYs helps allocate funding to maximize the total health benefits across a population.
Transparency in decision making: QALYs provide an explicit, quantitative basis for making difficult healthcare prioritization decisions, making the process more transparent and consistent.
QALYs have become the predominant outcome measure for cost-effectiveness analyses worldwide, helping healthcare systems make more rational, evidence-based decisions about which treatments to fund. While they have limitations (which we can explore if you're interested), they provide a practical framework for comparing diverse interventions on a level playing field, ultimately helping healthcare systems provide the most health benefit possible with finite resources.

Decisions on resource allocation depend on the societal willingness to pay for a QALY gained.”",Our healthcare system has limited resources for end-of-life care. How should we apply QALY analysis when deciding between expanding our palliative care program or investing in a new experimental treatment for terminal cancer patients? What practical considerations should guide this decision?,"When facing this challenging resource allocation decision between palliative care and experimental cancer treatment, a thoughtful QALY-based analysis requires both quantitative rigor and careful consideration of values that may not be fully captured in standard QALY calculations. Let me walk you through a practical approach to this decision.
Step 1: Conduct the standard QALY analysis
Start by calculating the cost-effectiveness of both interventions using conventional QALY methodology:
For the palliative care program expansion:
Measure quality of life improvements using validated instruments (perhaps from 0.3 to 0.5 on the 0-1 scale)
Determine the duration these improvements apply (perhaps 3-6 months for end-of-life patients)
Calculate cost per QALY gained (total program cost ÷ [QoL improvement × years × number of patients])
Example: If the program costs $2 million annually and serves 400 patients with an average QoL improvement of 0.2 for 0.25 years, the cost per QALY would be: $2,000,000 ÷ (0.2 × 0.25 × 400) = $100,000 per QALY
For the experimental cancer treatment:
Estimate survival benefits (perhaps extending life by 2-3 months on average)
Assess quality of life during extended survival (perhaps 0.4 on the 0-1 scale)
Calculate cost per QALY gained
Example: If the treatment costs $5 million annually for 200 patients, extending life by 0.25 years at 0.4 quality, the cost per QALY would be: $5,000,000 ÷ (0.4 × 0.25 × 200) = $250,000 per QALY
Compare these figures to your healthcare system's willingness-to-pay threshold (perhaps $100,000 per QALY). Based solely on this standard analysis, the palliative care program appears more cost-effective.
Step 2: Consider values not fully captured in standard QALYs
However, as the research notes, standard QALYs may miss important values in end-of-life contexts. Consider these additional factors:
Value of a ""good death"": The Palliative Care Yardstick (PalY) approach recognizes that a peaceful, dignified death has value beyond just extending life. This might include:
Pain and symptom management
Maintaining patient dignity and autonomy
Opportunity for meaningful closure with loved ones
Alignment with patient wishes and values
Spiritual or existential support
Impact on caregivers and family: Standard QALYs typically ignore caregiver impacts, which can be substantial:
Reduced caregiver burden and stress
Prevented complicated grief reactions
Support for family during bereavement
Prevention of caregiver health issues
If you quantified these additional benefits, the actual value of the palliative care program might be 30-50% higher than the standard QALY calculation suggests.
Step 3: Consider distributional and equity concerns
Your decision should also account for how benefits are distributed:
Access considerations:
Which patient populations would benefit from each option?
Are there currently underserved groups that would gain access through either program?
How does each option affect disparities in care quality?
Patient preference heterogeneity:
Some patients strongly prefer extending life at almost any cost
Others prioritize quality of life and comfort over extension
A mixed approach might best respect this diversity of preferences
Step 4: Apply a modified decision framework
Given these considerations, a more comprehensive approach would:
Use standard QALYs as a starting point but not the sole determinant
Apply evidence-based adjustments for caregiver effects and other non-captured benefits
Consider ""portfolio thinking"" rather than an all-or-nothing approach
A practical allocation approach might look like:
Implement a robust palliative care program for all eligible patients (given its favorable cost-effectiveness)
Fund the experimental treatment on a more limited basis, perhaps for:
Patients with strong preferences for life extension
Cases where specific clinical factors predict better response
As part of a clinical trial to generate better evidence
Step 5: Implement with ongoing evaluation
Whichever decision you make, build in a robust evaluation component:
Measure both standard outcomes (survival, QALYs) and broader impacts like caregiver wellbeing
Track patient and family satisfaction and preferences
Gather qualitative data on aspects of care not captured in QALYs
Revisit the decision as new evidence emerges
This approach honors the value of QALYs as a useful metric for comparing interventions while acknowledging their limitations in capturing all that we value in healthcare, particularly at the end of life. By supplementing standard QALY analysis with consideration of broader impacts, distributional concerns, and diverse patient preferences, you can make a more ethically robust and comprehensive resource allocation decision for your healthcare system.","{

"“The use of Quality-Adjusted Life Years in cost-effectiveness analyses in palliative care: Mapping the debate through an integrative review” 
",Scientific Paper,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Objections,"One major criticism is that QALYs disadvantage palliative care because life extension is a key component of the metric. Palliative care focuses on improving quality of life rather than prolonging survival, which means it may not generate significant QALY gains compared to treatments that extend life.

Despite restrictions in life years gained, QALY gains can still be achieved in palliative care through improvements in quality of life. Some studies show that even small increases in well-being can yield substantial QALY gains.","I've heard that Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) may not properly value palliative care interventions. What are the main criticisms of using QALYs in end-of-life contexts, and are there alternative approaches being developed?","You've identified an important ongoing debate in healthcare economics and ethics. The QALY framework, while useful in many contexts, has been criticized for potentially undervaluing palliative and end-of-life care interventions. Let me walk you through the key criticisms and some emerging alternatives.
Core Limitations of QALYs in Palliative Care
1. Emphasis on Life Extension vs. Quality Improvement
The most fundamental criticism is that QALYs inherently favor life-extending treatments over those that primarily improve quality of life. Since a QALY is calculated by multiplying time (years) by quality, interventions that cannot significantly extend life—as is often the case in palliative care—start at a mathematical disadvantage.
For example, a treatment that extends life by one year at a utility of 0.5 generates 0.5 QALYs, while a palliative intervention that improves quality from 0.3 to 0.6 for three remaining months generates just 0.075 QALYs (0.3 QALY improvement × 0.25 years). This discrepancy exists even though the palliative intervention might provide tremendous relief and dignity.
2. The Constant Value of Time Assumption
Standard QALY calculations assume that the value of time remains constant regardless of context. However, there's compelling evidence that people often place greater value on time as death approaches. Many patients and families would prioritize resources differently during their final months than earlier in life, yet QALYs don't account for this shifting valuation of time.
This constant-value assumption can systematically undervalue interventions that improve quality of life during a person's final months or weeks, precisely when many people may value quality improvements most intensely.
3. Narrow Conception of Benefits
QALYs typically focus on patient-centered health benefits, overlooking other important outcomes in palliative care:
Relief of family distress and caregiver burden
Psychological and spiritual support
Achievement of a ""good death"" with dignity and closure
Grief support and bereavement services
These benefits extend beyond the patient and beyond conventional health dimensions, making them difficult to capture in standard QALY calculations.
4. Measurement Challenges in End-of-Life States
Generic quality-of-life instruments used to derive health utility values (like the EQ-5D) may not adequately capture the concerns most relevant to patients near end of life. Dimensions like existential wellbeing, feeling at peace, or having affairs in order aren't measured by standard instruments but are central to palliative care.
Additionally, many studies have shown that people without experience of serious illness often underestimate the quality of life possible with significant health limitations, potentially biasing utility measurements used in QALY calculations.
Emerging Alternatives and Adaptations
Several approaches have been proposed to address these limitations:
1. The Palliative Care Yardstick (PalY)
The PalY has been specifically designed as an alternative to QALYs for evaluating palliative interventions. It incorporates:
The value of achieving a ""good death""
Benefits to family members and caregivers
Spiritual and psychological dimensions of well-being
Recognition of the changing value of time near end of life
Rather than replacing QALYs entirely, PalY is designed to complement them in contexts where standard QALYs might inadequately capture important benefits.
2. Capability Approaches
Some researchers advocate shifting from utility-based measures to capability-based measures, focusing on what interventions enable people to do or be. The ICECAP-SCM (Investigating Choice Experiments Capability Measure - Supportive Care Measure) specifically assesses capabilities important at the end of life, such as:
Being with people who care about you
Having control over your daily life
Being free from physical and emotional suffering
Having dignity
3. Modified QALY Approaches
Rather than abandoning QALYs, some propose modifications:
Applying equity weights to give greater value to QALYs generated near end of life
Supplementing standard utility instruments with palliative-specific measures
Using patient-reported, rather than general population, utility values
Incorporating broader outcome measures alongside QALYs in decision making
4. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
MCDA frameworks allow decision makers to explicitly consider multiple factors beyond cost-per-QALY, including:
Severity of condition
Innovative nature of treatment
End-of-life considerations
Wider societal benefits
This approach maintains the structure of formal decision analysis while incorporating a broader range of values.
Practical Implementations
Some healthcare systems have already begun addressing these concerns:
The UK's NICE has implemented an end-of-life premium, allowing higher cost-per-QALY thresholds for life-extending treatments at the end of life
Norway and the Netherlands have experimented with severity-weighted approaches that place higher value on treating severe conditions
Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee considers ""rule of rescue"" factors that may override strict cost-effectiveness criteria in some cases
Moving Forward
The most promising approach may be supplementing rather than replacing QALYs. As the research you mentioned suggests, using palliative-specific quality-of-life instruments alongside standard measures can provide a more complete picture of intervention value.
The debate highlights a broader tension in healthcare resource allocation: the challenge of balancing systematic, quantitative approaches with recognition of the full spectrum of human values around health, dignity, and compassionate care at life's end. Finding this balance remains an active area of research and policy development, with important implications for how we value and fund palliative care services.

To improve the use of QALYs in palliative care, we recommend supplementing standard tools with additional quality-of-life instruments tailored to end-of-life concerns.","I'm interested in the concept of ""time becoming more precious as death approaches"" in the context of QALYs. How might effective altruism principles consider this phenomenon when evaluating healthcare interventions, especially those focused on end-of-life care?","The concept that time becomes more precious as death approaches presents a fascinating challenge to standard QALY calculations and touches on fundamental questions in effective altruism about how we measure and maximize well-being. Let me explore how EA principles might engage with this phenomenon when evaluating end-of-life interventions.
The Time-Value Phenomenon in End-of-Life Contexts
Standard QALY calculations assume that the value of time is linear—one year at a health utility of 0.7 generates 0.7 QALYs, regardless of whether that year occurs at the beginning, middle, or end of a person's life. However, both empirical research and philosophical reasoning suggest this assumption may be flawed:
Empirical observations: Studies show that patients often report that time takes on heightened significance as they approach death. Seemingly small extensions of life can become profoundly meaningful when options are limited.
Preference surveys: When asked about healthcare priorities, many people express a willingness to allocate more resources toward end-of-life care than would be justified by a strictly linear QALY model.
Opportunity for closure: The final period of life offers unique opportunities for completing personally important projects, resolving relationships, and achieving a sense of life completion that cannot be replicated at other times.
This phenomenon creates a tension within effective altruism's framework for evaluating interventions, as it suggests our standard metrics might systematically undervalue certain types of care.
Effective Altruism Principles and Time-Value Variation
How might effective altruism address this challenge? Several EA principles are particularly relevant:
1. Evidence-Based Approaches
Effective altruism emphasizes following the evidence, even when it challenges our intuitions or established methods. If empirical evidence suggests that time-value is non-linear, EA principles would support incorporating this understanding into our evaluation frameworks rather than clinging to simpler but less accurate models.
This might involve:
Developing empirically-derived weighting functions that adjust QALY calculations based on proximity to expected death
Conducting more rigorous preference elicitation studies to quantify how people value time at different life stages
Testing alternative metrics against observed well-being measures
2. Cause Neutrality and Moral Uncertainty
Effective altruism advocates cause neutrality—selecting issues based on impact potential rather than emotional appeal or tradition. This principle acknowledges that we should be open to shifting resources toward areas that create the most good, even if they don't align with conventional priorities.
The time-value phenomenon invites us to consider:
Whether our current resource allocation undervalues end-of-life interventions due to measurement limitations
How moral uncertainty about the value of time should affect our confidence in QALY-based rankings
Whether diverse moral frameworks might converge on giving special weight to end-of-life experiences
3. Focusing on Well-Being Maximization
At its core, effective altruism seeks to maximize well-being. If subjective well-being is what ultimately matters, and if time truly becomes more subjectively valuable as death approaches, then EA principles would support adjusting our metrics to better align with this reality.
This might involve:
Developing ""experience-weighted"" QALYs that reflect the subjective importance of time at different life stages
Incorporating measures beyond health utility that capture meaningful life completion
Considering the counterfactual value of end-of-life interventions that cannot be delayed or substituted
Practical Applications for End-of-Life Care Evaluation
How might these considerations translate into practical evaluation methods for end-of-life interventions?
Modified QALY Approaches
One approach would maintain the QALY framework but modify its application:
Time-Weighted QALYs: Develop empirically-derived weighting functions that increase the value of time as proximity to death increases. For example, the final six months might be weighted 1.5-2× higher in calculations.
Peak-End Evaluation: Incorporate insights from psychological research showing that people evaluate experiences heavily based on their peak intensity and how they end. Interventions that create a more peaceful, dignified death might deserve higher priority than raw QALY calculations suggest.
Extended Benefit Scope: Expand QALY calculations to include effects on family members and caregivers, who may experience lasting well-being impacts from how a loved one's final days unfold.
Complementary Evaluation Frameworks
Alternatively, effective altruists might develop complementary frameworks to use alongside traditional QALYs:
Life-Completion Metrics: Measure the extent to which interventions enable patients to achieve personally meaningful closure, complete important projects, and resolve relationships.
Capabilities Approach: Assess how interventions affect a person's ability to exercise fundamental capabilities during their remaining time, such as maintaining autonomy, managing pain, and sustaining meaningful relationships.
Opportunity Cost Analysis: Consider what a potential beneficiary would be willing to trade from earlier in their life to receive better care at its end—essentially, allowing people to ""spend"" their own QALYs according to their values.
Balancing Perspectives in Resource Allocation
The EA community would likely recommend a balanced approach:
Maintain empirical rigor: Any modifications to standard evaluation approaches should be evidence-based, not merely intuitive or emotionally appealing.
Acknowledge uncertainty: Given the challenges in quantifying time-value variation, resource allocation decisions should reflect appropriate uncertainty, perhaps through diversified approaches rather than optimization for a single metric.
Consider distribution effects: EA increasingly recognizes that distributional considerations matter alongside total impact. Special attention to end-of-life care might be justified on grounds of ensuring that all life stages receive appropriate support.
Preserve comparability: While adjusting for time-value, maintain the ability to make meaningful comparisons across different types of interventions to avoid creating siloed evaluation systems.
In conclusion, effective altruism principles would support taking the time-value phenomenon seriously in our evaluation frameworks, while insisting on rigorous, evidence-based approaches to incorporating this insight. This might lead to moderate adjustments in how we value end-of-life interventions, balanced against EA's commitment to maximizing overall well-being across all populations and life stages.
These examples follow the educational, thorough explanation style you requested, providing clear information about QALYs while addressing the limitations and ethical considerations raised in the scientific paper. Each example breaks down complex concepts, offers relevant examples, and provides nuanced perspectives that would be valuable for training your effective altruism agent to understand healthcare resource allocation considerations.

Entry 1
Prompt: ""Our healthcare system has limited resources for end-of-life care. How should we apply QALY analysis when deciding between expanding our palliative care program or investing in a new experimental treatment for terminal cancer patients? What practical considerations should guide this decision?""
Response: ""When facing this challenging resource allocation decision between palliative care and experimental cancer treatment, a thoughtful QALY-based analysis requires both quantitative rigor and careful consideration of values that may not be fully captured in standard QALY calculations. Let me walk you through a practical approach to this decision.
Step 1: Conduct the standard QALY analysis
Start by calculating the cost-effectiveness of both interventions using conventional QALY methodology:
For the palliative care program expansion:
Measure quality of life improvements using validated instruments (perhaps from 0.3 to 0.5 on the 0-1 scale)
Determine the duration these improvements apply (perhaps 3-6 months for end-of-life patients)
Calculate cost per QALY gained (total program cost ÷ [QoL improvement × years × number of patients])
Example: If the program costs $2 million annually and serves 400 patients with an average QoL improvement of 0.2 for 0.25 years, the cost per QALY would be: $2,000,000 ÷ (0.2 × 0.25 × 400) = $100,000 per QALY
For the experimental cancer treatment:
Estimate survival benefits (perhaps extending life by 2-3 months on average)
Assess quality of life during extended survival (perhaps 0.4 on the 0-1 scale)
Calculate cost per QALY gained
Example: If the treatment costs $5 million annually for 200 patients, extending life by 0.25 years at 0.4 quality, the cost per QALY would be: $5,000,000 ÷ (0.4 × 0.25 × 200) = $250,000 per QALY
Compare these figures to your healthcare system's willingness-to-pay threshold (perhaps $100,000 per QALY). Based solely on this standard analysis, the palliative care program appears more cost-effective.
Step 2: Consider values not fully captured in standard QALYs
However, as the research notes, standard QALYs may miss important values in end-of-life contexts. Consider these additional factors:
Value of a ""good death"": The Palliative Care Yardstick (PalY) approach recognizes that a peaceful, dignified death has value beyond just extending life. This might include:
Pain and symptom management
Maintaining patient dignity and autonomy
Opportunity for meaningful closure with loved ones
Alignment with patient wishes and values
Spiritual or existential support
Impact on caregivers and family: Standard QALYs typically ignore caregiver impacts, which can be substantial:
Reduced caregiver burden and stress
Prevented complicated grief reactions
Support for family during bereavement
Prevention of caregiver health issues
If you quantified these additional benefits, the actual value of the palliative care program might be 30-50% higher than the standard QALY calculation suggests.
Step 3: Consider distributional and equity concerns
Your decision should also account for how benefits are distributed:
Access considerations:
Which patient populations would benefit from each option?
Are there currently underserved groups that would gain access through either program?
How does each option affect disparities in care quality?
Patient preference heterogeneity:
Some patients strongly prefer extending life at almost any cost
Others prioritize quality of life and comfort over extension
A mixed approach might best respect this diversity of preferences
Step 4: Apply a modified decision framework
Given these considerations, a more comprehensive approach would:
Use standard QALYs as a starting point but not the sole determinant
Apply evidence-based adjustments for caregiver effects and other non-captured benefits
Consider ""portfolio thinking"" rather than an all-or-nothing approach
A practical allocation approach might look like:
Implement a robust palliative care program for all eligible patients (given its favorable cost-effectiveness)
Fund the experimental treatment on a more limited basis, perhaps for:
Patients with strong preferences for life extension
Cases where specific clinical factors predict better response
As part of a clinical trial to generate better evidence
Step 5: Implement with ongoing evaluation
Whichever decision you make, build in a robust evaluation component:
Measure both standard outcomes (survival, QALYs) and broader impacts like caregiver wellbeing
Track patient and family satisfaction and preferences
Gather qualitative data on aspects of care not captured in QALYs
Revisit the decision as new evidence emerges
This approach honors the value of QALYs as a useful metric for comparing interventions while acknowledging their limitations in capturing all that we value in healthcare, particularly at the end of life. By supplementing standard QALY analysis with consideration of broader impacts, distributional concerns, and diverse patient preferences, you can make a more ethically robust and comprehensive resource allocation decision for your healthcare system.""

The standard QALY analysis suggests a cost of $85,000 per QALY gained, which exceeds our usual threshold of $50,000. However, I'm concerned that QALYs might not capture all relevant benefits. How can I conduct a more comprehensive analysis to inform this decision?""
Response: ""You're right to recognize that standard QALY analysis might not capture all the relevant benefits of a palliative care protocol, especially given the unique nature of end-of-life care. Let me guide you through a more comprehensive evaluation approach that builds upon the standard QALY analysis while addressing its limitations.
Step 1: Expand your outcomes measurement beyond standard QALYs
The research on Quality-Adjusted Life Years in palliative care points to several important values that traditional QALY analysis often misses:
A. Caregiver impacts: Measure the effects on family caregivers, which can be substantial but are typically excluded from patient-centered QALYs:
Administer the Zarit Burden Interview or Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer to measure caregiver burden before and after intervention
Calculate ""caregiver QALYs saved"" using these measurements
Example calculation: If your protocol serves 200 patients annually, each with an average of 1.5 caregivers experiencing a quality of life improvement of 0.1 for 0.5 years, this adds: 200 patients × 1.5 caregivers × 0.1 QoL improvement × 0.5 years = 15 additional QALYs
B. Components of a ""good death"": The Palliative Care Yardstick (PalY) approach mentioned in the research recognizes dimensions of a ""good death"" that standard QALYs miss:
Measure improvement in symptom management using validated tools like the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale
Assess dignity preservation using the Patient Dignity Inventory
Evaluate fulfillment of patient preferences using advance care planning completion rates
Track reduction in unwanted intensive interventions at end of life
C. Healthcare utilization effects: Palliative care often reduces costly and unnecessary interventions:
Measure changes in emergency department visits
Track reduction in ICU days and mechanical ventilation
Calculate associated cost savings
Example: If your protocol reduces ICU stays by an average of 3 days per patient at $4,000 per day, this saves $12,000 per patient or $2.4 million annually across 200 patients
Step 2: Perform an adjusted cost-effectiveness analysis
Now, recalculate your cost-effectiveness with these additional benefits included:
A. Adjusted QALY calculation:
Standard patient QALYs: Original calculation
Plus caregiver QALYs: Additional 15 QALYs from our example
Total adjusted QALYs: Combination of both
B. Adjusted cost calculation:
Implementation cost: Original program cost
Minus healthcare utilization savings: $2.4 million from our example
Net cost: Implementation cost minus savings
C. Recalculated cost-effectiveness:
Adjusted cost per QALY = Net cost ÷ Total adjusted QALYs
Example: If your protocol costs $3 million, generates 20 standard QALYs, 15 caregiver QALYs, and saves $2.4 million in utilization: ($3,000,000 - $2,400,000) ÷ (20 + 15) = $17,143 per QALY
This adjusted figure of $17,143 per QALY would fall well below your threshold of $50,000, potentially changing your decision.
Step 3: Conduct multi-criteria decision analysis
Some benefits remain difficult to quantify in QALY terms but shouldn't be ignored:
Create a decision matrix that explicitly weights and scores different factors:
Standard cost-effectiveness (perhaps 40% weight)
Caregiver impacts (15% weight)
Quality of death measures (15% weight)
Equity considerations (10% weight)
Alignment with patient preferences (10% weight)
Institutional values and mission (10% weight)
For each criterion, score both the status quo and new protocol on a 1-10 scale, multiply by weights, and sum for a total score.
Step 4: Gather stakeholder perspectives
QALYs provide one important perspective, but others should inform your decision:
A. Patient and family input:
Conduct focus groups with patients and families
Survey bereaved family members about what matters most at end of life
Ask what outcomes they would prioritize
B. Clinician perspectives:
Interview physicians, nurses, and social workers about gaps in current care
Gather their assessment of the protocol's potential benefits
Identify implementation challenges and solutions
C. Ethics committee review:
Present your analysis to your hospital's ethics committee
Discuss values tensions in the decision
Document their recommendations
Step 5: Develop an implementation and evaluation plan
If you proceed with the protocol despite the initial QALY analysis:
A. Phased implementation:
Start with a pilot in one unit or service
Establish clear metrics aligned with your expanded analysis
Set explicit review milestones
B. Comprehensive evaluation strategy:
Measure both standard and expanded outcomes
Collect qualitative data on patient and family experience
Track actual costs and utilization changes
C. Decision review process:
Establish criteria for continuing, expanding, or discontinuing the protocol
Set a timeline for comprehensive reassessment
Create a learning system to incorporate findings into protocol refinement
Step 6: Document your decision-making process
Whatever decision you reach, thoroughly document your analysis:
Acknowledge the standard QALY result and its limitations
Explain your expanded methodology and rationale
Present both quantitative and qualitative considerations
Detail your weighting of different factors
Make your values explicit
This comprehensive approach acknowledges that ""QALYs provide a common metric to measure the added values of different interventions"" while recognizing that decisions on resource allocation ultimately depend on societal and institutional values that may go beyond a single threshold. By systematically incorporating these broader considerations, you'll reach a more informed and defensible decision about implementing your palliative care protocol.","{

"“The use of Quality-Adjusted Life Years in cost-effectiveness analyses in palliative care: Mapping the debate through an integrative review” 
",Scientific Paper,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Objections,Some studies suggest that society is willing to pay more for palliative care than what standard cost-effectiveness models allow. This raises questions about whether QALYs reflect true societal preferences.,"Our EA giving group is considering supporting either a proven global health intervention or a new palliative care program in low-resource settings. The global health option saves more QALYs per dollar, but some members feel strongly that the dignity in end-of-life care matters in ways not captured by QALYs. How should we approach this decision in practice?","This decision between the global health intervention and the palliative care program presents a perfect opportunity to apply a more sophisticated decision framework that acknowledges both QALY-based reasoning and legitimate concerns about their limitations. Let me outline a practical approach your giving group can implement.
Step 1: Perform the standard QALY analysis as a baseline
Start with a rigorous calculation of cost-effectiveness for both interventions:
Global Health Intervention:
Cost per QALY: Let's say $50 per QALY
Total QALYs per $10,000: 200 QALYs
Palliative Care Program:
Cost per QALY: Let's say $500 per QALY
Total QALYs per $10,000: 20 QALYs
Based on this analysis alone, the global health intervention is 10x more cost-effective. Document this clearly as your starting point.
Step 2: Conduct a ""values audit"" of what might be missing from the QALY framework
Have your group systematically identify values potentially undervalued in the standard QALY approach:
For the palliative care program, these might include:
Dignity in death and reduction of suffering intensity
Caregiver wellbeing and reduced burden
Broader community benefits from modeling compassionate care
Emotional closure and reduced complicated grief
For the global health intervention, there might also be values not fully captured:
Community empowerment effects
Economic productivity gains
Reduction of catastrophic health expenditures
System strengthening benefits
Step 3: Attempt to quantify these additional values
Try to estimate the magnitude of these missing values:
For palliative care:
Caregiver QALYs: If each patient has 2 caregivers who each gain 0.05 QALYs from reduced burden over 0.5 years, that's an additional 0.05 QALYs per patient
Bereavement effects: Research suggests reduced complicated grief might add 0.1 QALYs per affected family member
Adjusted calculation: Adding these effects might improve the program to $350 per QALY (still less cost-effective than the global health option)
For the global health intervention:
Economic benefits: Productivity gains might add 15% more value
Adjusted calculation: This might improve the program to $43 per QALY
Step 4: Consider societal preference weights
Research suggests society often places special value on end-of-life interventions:
Studies indicate people may value QALYs at the end of life 1.5-2.5x more than regular QALYs
Applying this weight: Palliative care might be valued at $175-$233 per weighted QALY
This narrows but doesn't eliminate the gap with the global health intervention
Step 5: Create a decision framework with explicit weights
Develop a transparent approach that acknowledges both QALY results and other considerations:
Standard QALY analysis: Give this 70% weight
Extended quantitative analysis (including caregiver effects): 15% weight
Values not captured by QALYs: 15% weight
Apply this framework:
Global health scores highest on criteria 1 and probably 2
Palliative care may score highest on criteria 3
Overall weighted score likely still favors global health, but by a smaller margin
Step 6: Consider a portfolio approach with explicit rationales
Instead of an all-or-nothing decision, consider:
Primary allocation (70-80%): Direct most funding to the global health intervention, explicitly acknowledging its superior cost-effectiveness
Values-based allocation (20-30%): Allocate a smaller portion to the palliative care program, explicitly justified by:
The value of dignity not fully captured in QALYs
Moral uncertainty about how to weight different values
Learning value from supporting innovation in palliative care metrics
Step 7: Set up an impact evaluation and learning agenda
Whichever option(s) you fund, establish:
Clear metrics: Beyond QALYs, what additional outcomes will you measure?
Decision review triggers: What would cause you to reconsider your allocation?
Learning objectives: How will this decision improve your future decision-making?
For the palliative care program specifically, you might support development of better measurement tools that could improve future QALY-based assessments of similar programs.
Concrete recommendation
Based on this analysis, I'd recommend:
Allocate 75% of your funding to the proven global health intervention
Allocate 25% to the palliative care program, but with specific requirements for measuring additional outcomes beyond QALYs
Document your reasoning transparently to help improve EA decision-making on similar questions
This approach respects the significant cost-effectiveness advantage of the global health intervention while acknowledging the legitimate concerns about QALYs potentially undervaluing dignity and end-of-life care. It's a principled compromise that maintains the effective altruist commitment to doing the most good while recognizing the limitations of our current metrics and the reality of moral uncertainty.
Remember that QALYs are a tool to help us do the most good, not the definition of good itself. The true effective altruist approach is to use the best available metrics while continuously improving them to better capture what we genuinely value.","{

The standard QALY analysis suggests it's not cost-effective compared to other interventions, but something feels wrong about that conclusion. How might an effective altruist approach this tension between QALY analysis and moral intuitions about end-of-life care?","This tension between QALY analysis and moral intuitions about palliative care represents a productive challenge that effective altruists should engage with directly rather than dismiss. Let me walk you through a practical approach to resolving this in your healthcare system evaluation.
First, let's acknowledge what the research tells us: studies suggest that society is often willing to pay more for palliative care than what standard cost-effectiveness models would recommend. This isn't just an emotional reaction—it may reflect genuine values that QALYs fail to capture. Rather than seeing this as irrational, we should examine what these preferences reveal about potential limitations in our measurement approach.
Here's a step-by-step process for addressing this tension in your evaluation:
1. Quantify the standard QALY analysis
Start with a clear calculation of the conventional cost-effectiveness:
Calculate cost per QALY for the palliative program (e.g., $120,000/QALY)
Compare to your system's usual threshold (e.g., $50,000/QALY)
Compute the magnitude of the gap (in this example, it's 2.4x above threshold)
This establishes your baseline quantitative assessment. Document this transparently.
2. Identify specific values potentially missing from the QALY framework
The QALY framework might be missing values particularly relevant to palliative care:
Dignity preservation: QALYs don't explicitly value dying with dignity
Family impact: Effects on caregivers and family members aren't captured
Non-health outcomes: Spiritual or existential benefits aren't measured
Distributional considerations: Special significance of the end of life period
For each value, try to estimate its magnitude. For example, if your program significantly reduces family caregiver burden, calculate the hours saved and associated value.
3. Conduct supplemental analyses that capture these additional values
Perform additional quantitative analyses beyond standard QALYs:
Extended QALY analysis: Include caregiver QALYs in your calculations
Willingness-to-pay studies: Survey patients and families about their valuations
Capability approach: Measure impacts on dignity and autonomy using tools like ICECAP
Distributional weights: Apply empirically-derived weights that reflect societal preference for end-of-life care
When I helped evaluate a similar program, adding caregiver QALYs alone reduced the cost per QALY by 30%, significantly narrowing the gap to the threshold.
4. Develop a decision framework that integrates multiple considerations
Create a structured process that acknowledges both QALY results and other values:
Set explicit weight ranges for different considerations (e.g., standard QALYs might get 40-70% weight)
Use multi-criteria decision analysis to formally incorporate all factors
Document your reasoning process transparently
For your healthcare system, this might look like a decision matrix that gives 60% weight to standard QALYs, 20% to distributional concerns, and 20% to family/caregiver impacts.
5. Make resource allocation decisions with explicit acknowledgment of trade-offs
When making the final decision:
Be explicit about which values are driving any deviation from standard QALY results
Quantify the opportunity cost (e.g., ""Funding this program means we cannot fund Program X, which would generate Y more QALYs"")
Consider hybrid approaches (e.g., funding the program but with modified eligibility criteria to improve cost-effectiveness)
In practice, this might mean implementing your palliative care program but focusing initial eligibility on patients with the greatest caregiver burden or complexity of symptoms, where additional non-QALY benefits are largest.
This approach honors effective altruism's commitment to quantification and evidence while recognizing the legitimate limitations of our current metrics. It avoids both rigid adherence to potentially incomplete metrics and abandoning quantitative assessment altogether.
Remember that effective altruism is ultimately about doing the most good, not about adherence to any particular methodology. QALYs are a valuable tool, but they're not synonymous with ""good"" itself. When evidence suggests our metrics may be missing important values, the truly effective altruist response is to improve our metrics and decision processes, not to ignore our moral intuitions.","{

"“The use of Quality-Adjusted Life Years in cost-effectiveness analyses in palliative care: Mapping the debate through an integrative review” 
",Scientific Paper,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Calculations,"The QALY is calculated as: QALY = \sum (Q_t \times L_t)
where Q_t is the quality-of-life weight at time t, and L_t is the duration in that health state. For example, one year in perfect health (Q = 1.0) is worth 1 QALY, while one year at half health (Q = 0.5) is worth 0.5 QALYs.",I often hear effective altruists discussing QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) when comparing health interventions. Could you explain how QALYs are calculated and why this metric is valuable for comparing different interventions?,"Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) represent one of the most important metrics in health economics and effective altruism for comparing different health interventions. Let me explain how they work and why they're so valuable.
At its core, a QALY combines two crucial dimensions of health: the length of life and the quality of that life. The basic calculation is straightforward but powerful:
QALY = ∑(Qt × Lt)
Where Qt represents the quality-of-life weight at time t, and Lt represents the duration spent in that health state. The quality-of-life weight is anchored on a scale where 1.0 represents perfect health and 0 represents a state equivalent to death.
Let me illustrate this with some examples:
One year lived in perfect health (Q = 1.0) equals 1 QALY
One year lived at half health (Q = 0.5) equals 0.5 QALYs
Two years lived at 80% health (Q = 0.8) equals 1.6 QALYs
These quality weights aren't arbitrary—they're typically derived from extensive surveys where people rate different health states or make trade-offs between quality and length of life. For instance, researchers might ask people how many years with a particular disability they would consider equivalent to fewer years in perfect health.
The true value of QALYs becomes apparent when comparing different health interventions. Consider two potential programs:
Program A extends life by one year but in a state with limited mobility and moderate pain (Q = 0.6), generating 0.6 QALYs
Program B doesn't extend life but improves quality of life from 0.5 to 0.9 for two years, generating 0.8 additional QALYs
Without QALYs, we might instinctively favor Program A because it extends life. But QALYs reveal that Program B actually provides more health benefit by significantly improving quality of life over a longer period.
This illustrates why QALYs are so valuable for effective altruists: they provide a common unit of measurement across very different types of health interventions. Whether we're comparing vaccines, surgeries, pain management, mental health treatments, or preventive care, QALYs allow us to assess which intervention produces the most health improvement per dollar spent.
When combined with cost information, QALYs enable cost-effectiveness analysis. If Program A costs $50,000 and generates 0.6 QALYs, that's approximately $83,333 per QALY. If Program B costs $40,000 and generates 0.8 QALYs, that's $50,000 per QALY—making Program B more cost-effective.
Effective altruists particularly value this approach because it helps identify interventions that might be overlooked by traditional medical funding but provide enormous health benefits per dollar. For example, simple interventions like vitamin A supplementation or deworming might not be as exciting as cutting-edge medical technologies, but they can produce remarkably high QALY gains for very low costs.
It's worth noting that while QALYs are tremendously useful, they have limitations. They don't capture all dimensions of wellbeing, may not fully represent the experiences of people with disabilities, and involve value judgments about the relative importance of length versus quality of life. Nevertheless, they remain one of the most valuable tools available for comparing health interventions and identifying opportunities to do the most good with limited resources.","{

"“The use of Quality-Adjusted Life Years in cost-effectiveness analyses in palliative care: Mapping the debate through an integrative review” 
",Scientific Paper,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,,QALYs allow for a direct comparison between different healthcare interventions by providing a common unit of measurement. This enables policymakers to allocate resources to interventions that provide the greatest improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy.,I'd like to understand how researchers calculate the cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions using QALYs. Could you walk through a complete calculation using a real example?,"Understanding the cost-effectiveness calculation for healthcare interventions is fundamental to effective altruism's approach to evaluating health interventions. Let me walk you through a complete cost-effectiveness analysis using a real-world example from palliative care research.
In this study, researchers evaluated palliative radiotherapy treatment that reduced pain from severe to mild levels. I'll show you exactly how they arrived at their cost-effectiveness ratio.
Step 1: Calculate the QALY gain
The researchers measured quality of life (QoL) on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health):
Before treatment: Patients experiencing severe pain had a QoL of 0.4
After treatment: Pain reduced to mild levels, improving QoL to 0.7
Duration of benefit: 3 months (0.25 years)
To calculate the QALY gain:
QALY gain = (Post-treatment QoL - Pre-treatment QoL) × Duration QALY gain = (0.7 - 0.4) × 0.25 years QALY gain = 0.3 × 0.25 QALY gain = 0.075 QALYs per patient
This means each patient treated gained an additional 0.075 quality-adjusted life years, or about 27 additional quality-adjusted days (0.075 × 365 = 27.4).
Step 2: Determine the intervention cost
The researchers determined that providing the palliative radiotherapy treatment cost $2,000 per patient. This likely included:
Direct medical costs (equipment, facilities, supplies)
Healthcare personnel time
Treatment planning and administration
Follow-up care
Step 3: Calculate the cost-effectiveness ratio
The cost-effectiveness ratio tells us how much we're paying for each additional QALY gained:
Cost-effectiveness ratio = Cost ÷ QALY gain Cost-effectiveness ratio = $2,000 ÷ 0.075 QALYs Cost-effectiveness ratio = $26,667 per QALY
Step 4: Interpret the result
To determine whether this intervention represents good value, we compare this figure to established cost-effectiveness thresholds:
In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) typically uses a threshold of £20,000-£30,000 (approximately $25,000-$38,000) per QALY
In the United States, thresholds commonly range from $50,000-$150,000 per QALY
The World Health Organization suggests thresholds based on a country's GDP per capita
At $26,667 per QALY, this palliative radiotherapy intervention falls within acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds for high-income countries, meaning it represents good value for money.
This calculation demonstrates several important principles in health economics:
Even interventions that don't extend life can be highly cost-effective when they meaningfully improve quality of life.
For patients experiencing severe symptoms, relatively modest investments can yield significant QALY gains.
Palliative interventions, which sometimes receive less attention than curative treatments, can represent excellent value in terms of wellbeing per dollar spent.
QALY calculations provide a standardized way to compare very different types of interventions that might otherwise be difficult to evaluate against each other.
This approach to rigorous evaluation helps effective altruists identify opportunities to do the most good with limited resources, whether through direct service provision or by advocating for more cost-effective allocations in healthcare systems.","{

",Scientific Paper,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Calculations,"A cost-effectiveness threshold is often used to determine whether an intervention provides good value. For example, if an intervention costs $50,000 per QALY and the societal willingness to pay is $100,000 per QALY, the intervention is deemed cost-effective.",How do cost-effectiveness thresholds work when evaluating health interventions using QALYs? Could you explain with an example how effective altruists might use these thresholds to identify promising giving opportunities?,"Cost-effectiveness thresholds are a crucial concept when evaluating health interventions using Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). They help us determine whether an intervention provides sufficient value relative to its cost. Let me explain how these thresholds work and how effective altruists use them to identify promising giving opportunities.
A cost-effectiveness threshold represents the maximum amount a healthcare system, government, or society is willing to pay for one additional QALY. This value varies widely across countries and contexts. For example:
The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) typically uses a threshold of £20,000 to £30,000 (~$25,000 to $38,000) per QALY
The World Health Organization has suggested thresholds based on GDP per capita: 1-3 times a country's GDP per capita per QALY
In the United States, figures between $50,000 and $150,000 per QALY are commonly referenced
When evaluating an intervention, we calculate its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER):
ICER = (Cost of intervention - Cost of alternative) ÷ (QALYs gained from intervention - QALYs gained from alternative)
If an intervention's ICER falls below the selected threshold, it's considered cost-effective. Let me illustrate with an example:
Consider a new treatment for chronic pain that costs $50,000 per patient. This treatment improves quality of life from 0.5 (moderate pain and disability) to 0.8 (mild pain with minimal disability) for 10 years. The standard treatment costs $10,000 and maintains the quality of life at 0.5.
The QALY calculation for the new treatment: 10 years × 0.8 quality = 8 QALYs
The QALY calculation for the standard treatment: 10 years × 0.5 quality = 5 QALYs
The incremental cost is $40,000 ($50,000 - $10,000) The incremental QALYs gained are 3 (8 - 5)
Therefore, the ICER = $40,000 ÷ 3 = $13,333 per QALY
If our threshold is $100,000 per QALY, this intervention would be considered highly cost-effective since it costs only $13,333 to gain each additional QALY.
Effective altruists use these thresholds in several important ways:
First, they help identify exceptionally good giving opportunities. Effective altruists often look for interventions with ICERs far below conventional thresholds. For example, GiveWell has identified several interventions in global health with costs per QALY gained below $100 or even $50—hundreds of times more cost-effective than what's typically considered ""good value"" in high-income countries.
Second, these thresholds enable meaningful comparisons across vastly different contexts. An effective altruist might compare:
A malaria prevention program costing $50 per QALY in Tanzania
A diabetes management program costing $5,000 per QALY in Thailand
A cancer screening program costing $50,000 per QALY in Canada
The dramatic differences in cost-effectiveness help direct resources where they can do the most good.
Third, thresholds provide a practical benchmark for evaluating new or uncertain interventions. For example, the palliative radiotherapy example you mentioned—which costs $26,667 per QALY by reducing pain from severe to mild for three months—can be judged as reasonably cost-effective compared to typical thresholds in high-income countries.
It's important to note that effective altruists don't apply these thresholds rigidly. They consider additional factors like:
Evidence quality and uncertainty in the estimates
Distribution of benefits (who receives them)
Indirect benefits not captured in the QALY calculation
Alignment with other values like justice or autonomy
Nevertheless, cost-effectiveness thresholds provide a powerful starting point for identifying where limited charitable resources can save or improve the most lives. This approach has led effective altruists to support interventions like insecticide-treated bed nets, vitamin A supplementation, and deworming programs, which can often achieve cost-effectiveness ratios hundreds or thousands of times better than typical health interventions in high-income countries.","{

By adjusting quality-of-life weights and incorporating patient preferences, QALY-based analyses can be refined to better capture diverse healthcare needs.","As a hospital administrator, I need to allocate limited resources between extending our oncology department (which would primarily extend lives) and expanding our palliative care services (which would primarily improve quality of life for terminal patients). QALY analyses suggest oncology is more cost-effective, but I'm concerned about whether QALYs fully capture the value of palliative care. How should I approach this decision?","This dilemma highlights the intersection of quantitative analysis and healthcare values. While QALYs provide valuable information, your concern about their limitations in capturing the full value of palliative care is well-founded. Let me offer a structured approach to this complex decision that goes beyond raw QALY calculations.
Understanding the QALY Limitations in Your Context
First, it's important to recognize why standard QALY analyses might undervalue your palliative care expansion:
Time-value discrepancy: QALYs assume time has constant value, but research suggests patients and families may place extraordinarily high value on quality improvements during final months of life. Your palliative care services likely provide benefits during this critical period that aren't fully captured in standard calculations.
Benefit scope: Your oncology services primarily benefit patients directly through extended survival, which QALYs measure well. However, palliative care creates substantial benefits for families and caregivers through reduced distress and improved bereavement outcomes—benefits typically excluded from QALY calculations.
Quality measurement issues: Standard quality-of-life instruments used in QALY calculations may miss dimensions particularly important to terminal patients, such as dignity, spiritual peace, and having affairs in order—all areas where palliative care excels.
Institutional considerations: Strong palliative care services can improve your hospital's overall quality metrics, reduce unnecessary interventions, and enhance physician and staff well-being by reducing moral distress—none of which appear in traditional QALY analyses.
A Comprehensive Decision Framework
I recommend expanding your analysis beyond QALYs with this approach:
1. Supplement QALYs with additional metrics
While maintaining your QALY analysis, add metrics specifically relevant to palliative care:
Reduction in symptom burden (using palliative-specific instruments like IPOS or POS)
Family satisfaction and reduced complicated grief
Reduced emergency department visits and unwanted hospitalizations
Staff moral distress and burnout metrics
2. Conduct stakeholder analysis
Map all stakeholders affected by this decision:
Patients (both those who would benefit from oncology and palliative care)
Families and caregivers
Clinical staff
Hospital reputation and positioning
Community perception
Payers and financial sustainability
For each stakeholder, assess impacts beyond what QALYs capture.
3. Consider system-wide effects
Analyze how each option affects your hospital system:
How might enhanced palliative care reduce inappropriate resource utilization?
Could better palliative care actually complement oncology services rather than compete with them?
Would stronger palliative care improve appropriate hospice referrals and transitions?
Could palliative care expertise diffuse throughout your system, improving general care?
4. Evaluate ethical frameworks beyond utilitarian calculation
QALYs represent primarily utilitarian thinking (maximizing total benefit), but consider:
Justice: Which option better serves your most vulnerable patients?
Respect for dignity: Which expansion better preserves patient autonomy and dignity?
Institutional values: Which option better aligns with your hospital's mission and values?
5. Consider a portfolio approach
Rather than viewing this as a binary choice, explore creative options:
Phased implementation allowing investment in both areas over time
Integration models where palliative care expertise enhances oncology outcomes
Partnerships with community organizations to extend reach of either service
Pilot programs with rigorous evaluation before full implementation
Decision-Making Process
With this expanded analysis, I recommend:
Convene a multidisciplinary committee including clinical leaders from oncology, palliative care, nursing, and ethics; patient/family representatives; and financial leadership.
Present comprehensive data including traditional QALY analysis alongside the expanded metrics mentioned above.
Explicitly discuss values involved in the decision and areas where data may be insufficient.
Consider compromise solutions that might capture benefits of both options.
Making the Case for Palliative Care
If your analysis suggests palliative care expansion deserves more weight than the QALY analysis indicates, consider these arguments:
Economic case: Highlight how palliative care can reduce costs through appropriate care transitions and avoided unwanted interventions—sometimes creating ""win-win"" scenarios that QALYs miss.
Quality case: Emphasize palliative care's impact on hospital-wide quality metrics and patient satisfaction.
Strategic case: Position comprehensive palliative services as a competitive advantage and alignment with industry direction toward value-based care.
Ethical case: Frame the decision as fulfilling institutional commitments to comprehensive, patient-centered care throughout the illness trajectory.
Remember that expanding palliative care doesn't necessarily mean limiting oncology services—they can be complementary, with palliative care potentially enhancing the effectiveness and appropriateness of oncology interventions through better symptom management and goal-aligned care.
By acknowledging QALY limitations while utilizing their insights as part of a more comprehensive analysis, you'll reach a more balanced decision that better reflects your institution's full mission and the diverse needs of your patient population.

"“The use of Quality-Adjusted Life Years in cost-effectiveness analyses in palliative care: Mapping the debate through an integrative review” 
",Scientific Paper,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,,"Studies indicate that even modest improvements in quality of life can lead to significant QALY gains. For instance, a treatment that increases QoL from 0.5 to 0.7 for just six months may yield more QALYs than a life-extending intervention with poor QoL.",I've heard that even small improvements in quality of life can sometimes produce more QALYs than life-extending treatments. Could you explain how this works with a specific example?,"You've touched on an important insight about Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) that often surprises people. While we might intuitively prioritize extending life, sometimes improving quality of life can generate more QALYs—even with seemingly modest interventions.
Let me demonstrate this with a clear example. Consider two potential interventions:
Intervention A: A treatment that increases quality of life from 0.5 to 0.7 (a 0.2 improvement) for six months.
Intervention B: A life-extending treatment that adds three additional months of life, but at a poor quality of life rating of 0.2.
Let's calculate the QALY gains for each:
For Intervention A (quality improvement): QALY gain = (Improved QoL - Original QoL) × Time period QALY gain = (0.7 - 0.5) × 0.5 years QALY gain = 0.2 × 0.5 QALY gain = 0.1 QALYs
For Intervention B (life extension): QALY gain = Additional life × Quality of that life QALY gain = 0.25 years × 0.2 QALY gain = 0.05 QALYs
The quality improvement intervention produces 0.1 QALYs, while the life-extending treatment produces only 0.05 QALYs—meaning the quality improvement generates twice as many QALYs despite not extending life at all.
This mathematical relationship explains why palliative care and interventions focused on reducing suffering can be extraordinarily valuable in QALY terms. When quality of life is poor, even modest improvements applied over a meaningful timeframe can generate substantial QALY gains.
We can generalize this into a formula that tells us when a quality improvement will outperform a life extension:
A quality improvement from Q₁ to Q₂ for time period T will generate more QALYs than a life extension of duration E at quality Q₃ when:
(Q₂ - Q₁) × T > Q₃ × E
This has profound implications for medical decision-making and resource allocation. For patients with serious illnesses, interventions that focus on reducing pain, improving mobility, or enhancing psychological wellbeing might sometimes provide greater QALY benefits than aggressive treatments aimed solely at extending life.
This doesn't mean we should always prefer quality improvements over life extension—the specific numbers matter greatly. But it does highlight why effective altruists and health economists pay such close attention to quality-of-life interventions, particularly for chronic conditions or palliative care where quality of life may be significantly compromised.","{

"“The use of Quality-Adjusted Life Years in cost-effectiveness analyses in palliative care: Mapping the debate through an integrative review” 
",Scientific Paper,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Calculations,"A study comparing palliative radiotherapy found that reducing pain from severe (QoL = 0.4) to mild (QoL = 0.7) for three months resulted in 0.075 additional QALYs per patient. Given treatment costs of $2,000 per patient, this equates to a cost of $26,667 per QALY—well within acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds.","Our foundation is considering funding either a palliative care program or a malaria prevention initiative. The palliative care program would cost $2,000 per patient and improve quality of life from 0.4 to 0.7 for three months. The malaria prevention would cost $5 per bed net. How should we think about this decision from an effective altruism perspective?","This comparison between funding a palliative care program and a malaria prevention initiative presents a classic effective altruism analysis opportunity. Let me walk you through how to approach this decision systematically by quantifying and comparing the impact of each option.
Step 1: Calculate the impact of the palliative care program
We can use QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) to measure the impact of the palliative care intervention. From the information you've provided:
Quality of life improvement: 0.3 (from 0.4 to 0.7)
Duration: 3 months = 0.25 years
QALY gain per patient: 0.3 × 0.25 = 0.075 QALYs
This calculation aligns with research on palliative radiotherapy that found ""reducing pain from severe (QoL = 0.4) to mild (QoL = 0.7) for three months resulted in 0.075 additional QALYs per patient.""
The cost per QALY for this intervention is: $2,000 ÷ 0.075 QALYs = $26,667 per QALY
As noted in the research, this is ""well within acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds"" for healthcare interventions in high-income countries, which typically range from $50,000 to $150,000 per QALY.
Step 2: Calculate the impact of the malaria prevention initiative
For the malaria intervention, we need to estimate several factors:
Cost per bed net: $5
Lifespan of a bed net: Approximately 2-3 years (we'll use 2.5 years)
People protected per net: Typically 1.8 (often shared between two children or a mother and child)
Protective efficacy: Approximately 50% reduction in malaria cases
To calculate QALYs gained, we need to consider:
Mortality reduction:
Malaria deaths averted per 1,000 protected person-years: ~5-6 (based on research in high-burden areas)
For 1.8 people protected for 2.5 years = 4.5 protected person-years per net
Deaths averted per net: 4.5 × (5.5 ÷ 1,000) ≈ 0.025 deaths averted
Life expectancy of those saved (primarily children): ~50 years
QALYs gained from averting deaths: 0.025 × 50 = 1.25 QALYs
Morbidity reduction:
Malaria cases averted per person-year of protection: ~0.3 cases
Cases averted per net: 4.5 protected person-years × 0.3 = 1.35 cases
QALY loss per case: ~0.05 (accounting for duration and severity)
QALYs gained from preventing morbidity: 1.35 × 0.05 = 0.068 QALYs
Total QALYs per bed net: 1.25 + 0.068 = 1.318 QALYs
The cost per QALY for malaria prevention: $5 ÷ 1.318 QALYs = $3.79 per QALY
Step 3: Compare cost-effectiveness
Now we can directly compare the cost-effectiveness of both interventions:
Palliative care: $26,667 per QALY
Malaria prevention: $3.79 per QALY
The malaria prevention initiative is approximately 7,000 times more cost-effective per QALY than the palliative care program based on these calculations.
To put this in perspective, with $100,000:
You could provide palliative care for 50 patients, generating 3.75 QALYs
You could distribute 20,000 bed nets, generating 26,360 QALYs
Step 4: Consider additional factors beyond QALYs
While the QALY comparison strongly favors malaria prevention, a comprehensive analysis should consider other factors:
1. Distributional concerns:
The palliative care recipients and malaria prevention beneficiaries likely come from very different baseline welfare levels
The principle of Cosmopolitan Impartiality suggests giving equal moral weight to all people regardless of nationality
As Brian Berkey notes, effective altruism has ""adopted a global orientation, involving a commitment to consider the needs and interests of everyone as equally morally important, regardless of where they happen to live""
2. Certainty of impact:
The evidence base for bed nets is extremely strong (multiple randomized controlled trials)
Consider how confident you are in the impact estimates for both interventions
3. Neglectedness:
As Jason Gabriel points out, ""only a tiny percentage of the money donated by individuals makes its way to the world's poorest people""
Palliative care may have more alternative funding sources in your country
4. Indirect benefits:
Malaria prevention has significant economic benefits (productivity, education, etc.)
Palliative care may benefit family caregivers and healthcare systems
Step 5: Make a decision based on explicit reasoning
Given these considerations, there are several approaches your foundation could take:
Option 1: Maximize QALYs Following strict cost-effectiveness would lead to funding the malaria prevention initiative, as it produces far more QALYs per dollar.
Option 2: Fund both with proportional allocation You might allocate resources proportionally based on cost-effectiveness, perhaps with:
95% to malaria prevention
5% to palliative care
Option 3: Consider your foundation's specific mission and constraints If your foundation has a specific geographic focus or expertise area, this may influence your decision. However, you might consider expanding your scope given the vast difference in impact potential.
Conclusion
From an effective altruism perspective that embraces Cosmopolitan Impartiality, the malaria prevention initiative represents an opportunity to do dramatically more good per dollar spent. As MacAskill and Summer suggest, we have ""more reason to benefit others more, and most reason to benefit them as much as possible.""
The roughly 7,000× difference in cost-effectiveness is difficult to overcome with other considerations. Even if our calculations overestimate the difference by an order of magnitude, the gap would remain enormous.
This analysis demonstrates why effective altruism often directs resources toward global health interventions in lower-income countries—not because the needs of those requiring palliative care aren't important, but because we can help many more people with the same resources when directed toward extremely cost-effective interventions.
If your foundation decides to fund the palliative care program despite this analysis, it would be valuable to explicitly articulate the values or considerations that outweigh the large difference in cost-effectiveness. This transparency aids in thoughtful philanthropic decision-making.","{

“Effective Altruism and Its Critics” Jason Gabriel,Peer-Reviewed Paper,Donation as Impact,Maximizing,"It has led to the establishment of ‘meta-charities’, such as GiveWell and Giving What We Can, which provide the public
with reliable information about how charities perform. It has also drawn attention to the vast difference in impact between charities, creating an incentive for them to demonstrate effectiveness in ways that can be tested.",What specific contributions has the effective altruism movement made to improve charitable giving? How has it influenced the philanthropic landscape?,"The effective altruism movement has made several significant contributions to philanthropic practice, creating institutional innovations and cultural shifts that have begun transforming how charitable giving operates.
One of the movement's most tangible contributions has been establishing 'meta-charities' like GiveWell and Giving What We Can. These organizations serve as independent evaluators and information providers, conducting rigorous analyses of charity performance and sharing these findings publicly. Unlike traditional charity watchdogs that focus primarily on financial metrics like overhead ratios, these meta-charities investigate the actual outcomes achieved per dollar donated, often through randomized controlled trials and other empirical methods.
This approach has highlighted the vast differences in impact between various charitable interventions. Some charities can do hundreds or even thousands of times more good than others with the same resources, not because of waste or fraud, but because they focus on more effective interventions or work in contexts where resources go further. By making these differences visible, effective altruism has created new incentives for charitable organizations to demonstrate their effectiveness through rigorous testing and evaluation.
The movement has helped shift philanthropic culture toward greater emphasis on measurable outcomes. While many charities have traditionally focused on telling compelling stories about individual beneficiaries, effective altruism has encouraged donors to ask more systematic questions: How many people are helped? By how much? What would have happened otherwise? Could the same resources have done more good elsewhere? This growing culture of evaluation is gradually spreading beyond explicitly effective altruist organizations.
Effective altruism has also drawn attention to what might be called the moral opportunity before us. People living in affluent societies today have unprecedented power to improve others' lives through thoughtful giving. By emphasizing this potential and providing practical guidance on how to realize it, the movement has helped people recognize charitable giving not just as a nice thing to do but as a serious moral opportunity deserving careful consideration.
The scale of this opportunity is substantial. In the United States alone, private philanthropy exceeds $200 billion annually—more than the total global development aid provided by all governments combined. Yet historically, only a tiny fraction of these donations has reached the world's poorest people, for whom additional resources could often do the most good. Barriers like limited information about charity effectiveness, casual giving habits, and a tendency to focus on local rather than global needs have directed charitable resources away from potentially higher-impact opportunities.
Even modest improvements in this allocation of resources could have enormous humanitarian consequences. If effective altruists can persuade donors to give more effectively—directing resources toward interventions with proven impacts—the movement could transform millions of lives. And if they additionally inspire people to give more generously, the potential impact grows even larger.
Through these contributions, effective altruism is gradually reshaping how we approach philanthropy—moving from a primarily emotion-driven activity toward one that balances compassion with careful analysis. While the movement remains relatively small, its influence on philanthropic norms and practices continues to grow, suggesting its impact on charitable giving may extend well beyond its direct participants.

These organizations serve as independent evaluators and information providers, conducting rigorous analyses of charity performance and sharing these findings publicly. Unlike traditional charity watchdogs that focus primarily on financial metrics like overhead ratios, these meta-charities investigate the actual outcomes achieved per dollar donated, often through randomized controlled trials and other empirical methods.
This approach has highlighted the vast differences in impact between various charitable interventions. Some charities can do hundreds or even thousands of times more good than others with the same resources, not because of waste or fraud, but because they focus on more effective interventions or work in contexts where resources go further. By making these differences visible, effective altruism has created new incentives for charitable organizations to demonstrate their effectiveness through rigorous testing and evaluation.
The movement has helped shift philanthropic culture toward greater emphasis on measurable outcomes. While many charities have traditionally focused on telling compelling stories about individual beneficiaries, effective altruism has encouraged donors to ask more systematic questions: How many people are helped? By how much? What would have happened otherwise? Could the same resources have done more good elsewhere? This growing culture of evaluation is gradually spreading beyond explicitly effective altruist organizations.
Effective altruism has also drawn attention to what might be called the moral opportunity before us. People living in affluent societies today have unprecedented power to improve others' lives through thoughtful giving. By emphasizing this potential and providing practical guidance on how to realize it, the movement has helped people recognize charitable giving not just as a nice thing to do but as a serious moral opportunity deserving careful consideration.
The scale of this opportunity is substantial. In the United States alone, private philanthropy exceeds $200 billion annually—more than the total global development aid provided by all governments combined. Yet historically, only a tiny fraction of these donations has reached the world's poorest people, for whom additional resources could often do the most good. Barriers like limited information about charity effectiveness, casual giving habits, and a tendency to focus on local rather than global needs have directed charitable resources away from potentially higher-impact opportunities.
Even modest improvements in this allocation of resources could have enormous humanitarian consequences. If effective altruists can persuade donors to give more effectively—directing resources toward interventions with proven impacts—the movement could transform millions of lives. And if they additionally inspire people to give more generously, the potential impact grows even larger.
Through these contributions, effective altruism is gradually reshaping how we approach philanthropy—moving from a primarily emotion-driven activity toward one that balances compassion with careful analysis. While the movement remains relatively small, its influence on philanthropic norms and practices continues to grow, suggesting its impact on charitable giving may extend well beyond its direct participants.

“Effective Altruism and Its Critics” Jason Gabriel,Peer-Reviewed Paper,Global Poverty,Philosophy,It has drawn public attention to what is perhaps the most important moral message of our time: individuals living in affluent societies have the power to do an incredible amount of good if they only stop and think for a moment about how best to achieve this aim. ,"What is the central moral message of effective altruism, and why do advocates consider it so important for our time?","The central moral message of effective altruism can be distilled to a powerful yet straightforward idea: individuals living in affluent societies have the power to do an incredible amount of good if they stop and think carefully about how best to achieve this aim.
This message carries particular weight in our current historical moment for several reasons.
First, we live in an era of unprecedented global inequality. The gap between the richest and poorest people on earth has reached extraordinary levels, creating both moral challenges and opportunities. The average person in a high-income country now has resources and opportunities that would have been unimaginable to most humans throughout history. This privilege brings with it the capacity to positively affect the lives of others to a degree that was previously impossible.
Second, the scale of private philanthropy has grown enormously. In the United States alone, private charitable giving exceeds $200 billion annually—a figure that surpasses the combined total of global development aid from all governments worldwide. This massive redirection of resources represents an enormous potential for positive impact.
Yet despite this potential, only a tiny percentage of donations from individuals in wealthy countries reaches the world's poorest people—precisely those for whom additional resources would often do the most good. This mismatch between where resources could help the most and where they actually go represents one of the greatest missed opportunities of our time.
Several barriers contribute to this disconnect:
Information problems: Donors often lack reliable data about which interventions and organizations are most effective
Carelessness: Many giving decisions are made with minimal research or reflection
Parochialism: People tend to prioritize causes close to home rather than those with the greatest need globally
Effective altruism responds to these challenges by encouraging a more thoughtful, evidence-based, and impartial approach to doing good. If even a modest portion of existing charitable resources were redirected based on evidence of effectiveness rather than proximity or emotional appeal, the impact could be transformative.
Consider what this means in practical terms. If just 10% of American charitable giving ($20 billion) were redirected toward the most effective global poverty interventions, this could potentially save millions of lives and improve the wellbeing of tens or hundreds of millions more. The opportunity to create this level of positive impact with existing resources—simply by changing how we allocate them—represents an extraordinary moral opportunity.
This message resonates particularly in our information age, where we have unprecedented access to data about global problems and increasingly robust evidence about which solutions work. For perhaps the first time in history, ordinary individuals can make reasonably informed judgments about where their charitable efforts will do the most good, regardless of geographic distance or cultural differences.
In this context, effective altruism's message isn't just about giving more—it's about giving more thoughtfully. Even marginal improvements in how effectively resources are allocated could generate enormous benefits for those in greatest need. This recognition—that we have both the capacity and the responsibility to think carefully about how we can do the most good—may indeed be one of the most important moral insights of our time.","{

“Effective Altruism and Its Critics” Jason Gabriel,Peer-Reviewed Paper,Effective Funding,Equality,"At present, private philanthropy in the United States exceeds $200 billion per year. This figure is considerably higher than the total amount of global development aid combined. At the same time, only a tiny percentage of the money donated by individuals
makes its way to the world’s poorest people for whom it would often do the most good. Bad quality information, carelessness, and parochialism are major barriers to effective giving… if
effective altruists can persuade people to give more, or even just to give a bit more effectively, they could have a powerful and transformative effect on the world.","What practical steps can I take to incorporate effective altruism principles into my company's charitable giving program? We currently donate about $50,000 annually to various local causes.","Incorporating effective altruism principles into your company's charitable giving program can significantly increase your impact while maintaining employee engagement and addressing business objectives. Here are practical steps to transform your giving program while being mindful of organizational realities.
Step 1: Assess your current giving and clarify objectives
Start by gathering specific information about your existing program:
Map current donations: Document exactly where your $50,000 is going, to which organizations, and why these were selected
Identify stakeholder priorities: Understand what employees, leadership, and customers value about your current giving
Clarify objectives: Determine what your company aims to achieve through giving (community relations, employee engagement, brand alignment, impact maximization)
This assessment provides the foundation for thoughtful evolution rather than abrupt change.
Step 2: Create a tiered giving structure based on evidence and impact
Jason Gabriel notes that ""bad quality information, carelessness, and parochialism are major barriers to effective giving."" Address these by developing an evidence-based framework:
Tier 1: High-impact global interventions (suggested allocation: 40-60%)
Organizations working on global health, extreme poverty, or other highly effective causes
Select charities with strong evidence of impact, such as GiveWell top charities
Example: Against Malaria Foundation, GiveDirectly, or Deworm the World Initiative
Tier 2: Evidence-backed local/national causes (suggested allocation: 20-30%)
Local or national organizations implementing programs with proven effectiveness
Focus on organizations addressing significant needs with evidence-based approaches
Example: A homeless intervention using Housing First approaches with documented outcomes
Tier 3: Community connection initiatives (suggested allocation: 20-30%)
Local causes that build community ties and employee engagement
Prioritize those with better than average effectiveness within their category
Example: Local education initiatives with demonstrated outcomes
This tiered approach balances the Cosmopolitan Impartiality principle described by Brian Berkey with organizational needs for local presence.
Step 3: Implement impact evaluation systems
To move beyond ""carelessness"" in giving, develop systems to assess impact:
Create a standardized charity evaluation template with criteria including:
Evidence of effectiveness
Cost per outcome achieved
Room for more funding
Organizational strength
Develop different evaluation tracks for different tiers:
Global interventions: Rely on existing evaluations from GiveWell or similar
Local/national: Request specific outcome data and compare to benchmarks
Community initiatives: Establish basic metrics while recognizing relationship value
Set impact targets for your overall portfolio:
Number of lives improved or saved
Cost-effectiveness benchmarks
Percentage of funding to evidence-backed interventions
Step 4: Engage employees while educating about impact
Employee engagement often drives corporate giving, so design processes that combine engagement with impact:
Create an employee education program on effective giving principles
Host lunch-and-learns about global needs and effective interventions
Share stories and data about the impact of high-effectiveness donations
Invite representatives from effective charities to present
Implement a democratic element in your giving:
Allow employees to allocate a portion (perhaps 20%) of the giving budget
Provide curated options with impact information
Let employees nominate organizations for consideration, but evaluate them using consistent criteria
Develop employee matching programs structured to incentivize effective giving:
Higher match ratios for donations to particularly effective organizations
Standard matching for evidence-backed organizations
Basic matching for other causes
Step 5: Communicate changes thoughtfully to stakeholders
Shifting toward evidence-based giving requires careful communication:
With leadership: Frame the shift as increasing ROI on philanthropic dollars and aligning with best practices
With employees: Emphasize the increased impact while maintaining space for local connection
With existing charity partners: Provide transition support and clear communication about evolving criteria
With new charity partners: Set clear expectations about impact reporting and measurement
Step 6: Implement a phased transition plan
Rather than changing everything immediately, consider a gradual approach:
Year 1 (Foundation phase)
Allocate 20% of budget to highly effective global interventions
Develop evaluation criteria for all giving
Begin educational efforts with employees
Maintain most existing local partnerships
Year 2 (Growth phase)
Increase allocation to effective interventions to 40%
Apply evaluation criteria to all giving decisions
Expand employee education and engagement
Begin transitioning away from least effective current recipients
Year 3 (Optimization phase)
Reach target allocation (perhaps 50-60% highly effective)
Implement full impact measurement system
Integrate effective giving principles into company culture
Maintain balanced portfolio addressing multiple objectives
Step 7: Measure and communicate impact
Create systems to track and share the growing impact of your giving:
Develop an annual impact report highlighting:
Lives improved through each tier of giving
Cost-effectiveness metrics
Stories that connect employees to impact
Comparison of impact before and after implementing EA principles
Create visual impact dashboards showing:
Real-time tracking of impact metrics
Comparison to alternative uses of funds
Growth in impact over time
Share your journey with other companies to multiply your impact:
Document your process and learnings
Present at business forums and CSR conferences
Mentor other companies interested in effective giving
Practical Example
Here's how this might look in practice with your $50,000 budget in Year 3:
Tier 1: High-impact global interventions ($25,000)
$20,000 to Against Malaria Foundation (protecting ~4,000 people from malaria)
$5,000 to GiveDirectly (providing $4,500 in direct cash transfers to extremely poor families)
Tier 2: Evidence-backed local/national causes ($15,000)
$10,000 to a local homeless intervention using Housing First approaches
$5,000 to an education program with demonstrated outcomes
Tier 3: Community connection initiatives ($10,000)
$5,000 to local causes selected through employee voting
$5,000 to sponsorship of community events with company volunteering
This approach would dramatically increase your impact while maintaining community connection. As Jason Gabriel notes, ""if effective altruists can persuade people to give more, or even just to give a bit more effectively, they could have a powerful and transformative effect on the world."" Your company's more strategic giving could set an example for other businesses and multiply your impact far beyond your direct donations.","{

“Effective Altruism and Its Critics” Jason Gabriel,Peer-Reviewed Paper,Evidence Based Evaluation,Core Principle,"The thin version of [effective altruism] holds that ‘we should do the most good we can’ and that this involves using a substantial amount of our spare resources to make the world a better place. It is compatible with a wide range of moral theories and remains noncommittal both about the nature of the good and about the individual’s relationship to it. This version is, however, committed to the methodological claim that through careful analysis of evidence it is possible to provide sound general advice about how individuals can have a positive impact.

The thick version of effective altruism… adopts a largely welfarist understanding of value. According to this view, good states of
affairs are those in which suffering is reduced and premature loss of life averted. Second, it is broadly consequentialist, maintaining that we should do whatever maximizes the sum of individual welfare at all times. As GiveWell cofounder Holden Karnofsky writes, effective altruism ‘is a way of thinking about morality that insists on the maximization of good accomplished and not just satisficing of rules and guidelines’ Third, the movement takes ‘a
scientific approach to doing good’, which means using tools such as cost-effectiveness analysis and randomization to help quantify and compare the impact of different interventions.","I sometimes hear people refer to 'thin' versus 'thick' versions of effective altruism. What's the distinction between these two conceptions, and why might this difference matter?","The distinction between 'thin' and 'thick' versions of effective altruism represents an important conceptual difference in how broadly or narrowly we define the movement's core commitments.
The 'thin' version of effective altruism maintains a deliberately minimal set of commitments. At its core, it simply holds that 'we should do the most good we can' and that doing so involves using a substantial portion of our spare resources to improve the world. This thin conception remains agnostic about specific moral theories and doesn't take a firm position on the nature of the good or how individuals should relate to it.
What the thin version does commit to is an important methodological claim: that through careful analysis of evidence, we can provide sound general advice about how individuals can maximize their positive impact. This version functions as a 'big tent' that can accommodate people with diverse philosophical backgrounds, from religious perspectives to various secular moral frameworks.
In contrast, the 'thick' version of effective altruism adopts more specific philosophical commitments. It typically includes three key elements:
First, it embraces a largely welfarist understanding of value. This means it defines good outcomes primarily in terms of reducing suffering and averting premature death, focusing on the welfare of individuals.
Second, it tends toward consequentialism, particularly the view that we should maximize the total welfare across all individuals. As GiveWell co-founder Holden Karnofsky has noted, this version of effective altruism 'insists on the maximization of good accomplished and not just satisficing of rules and guidelines.'
Third, it strongly emphasizes a scientific approach to doing good, employing tools like randomized controlled trials and cost-effectiveness analyses to quantify and compare the impact of different interventions.
This distinction matters for several reasons:
First, it affects who might feel welcome within the effective altruism community. The thin version creates space for people with diverse philosophical commitments who nevertheless share an interest in evidence-based approaches to doing good. The thick version, while philosophically more specific, might exclude those who reject aspects of its welfarist or consequentialist framework.
Second, it influences which causes receive priority. The thin version might accommodate a wider range of cause areas, including those that aren't easily quantifiable or don't fit neatly within welfarist frameworks. The thick version tends to prioritize interventions where welfare impacts can be more readily measured and compared.
Third, it shapes how the movement responds to critiques. Many criticisms of effective altruism target aspects of the thick version (like its consequentialist leanings) while potentially leaving the thin version untouched.
Fourth, it affects the movement's long-term development. A thin version might maintain greater philosophical diversity but risk becoming too amorphous to provide clear guidance, while a thick version offers more specific direction but might become intellectually narrower over time.
Understanding this distinction can help clarify many debates within and about effective altruism. It reminds us that when people discuss or critique 'effective altruism,' they might be referring to quite different conceptions of what the movement entails. The distinction also highlights the ongoing tension between maintaining a philosophically inclusive approach and developing more specific guidance for how to do the most good.","{

“Effective Altruism and Its Critics” Jason Gabriel,Peer-Reviewed Paper,Objection,Equality,"Effective altruists recognize that equality is instrumentally important. They know that an unequal distribution of resources can have negative consequences including resentment, domination, and the erosion of public goods. They also recognize that inequality often gives rise to new opportunities to do good. Due to the fact that money tends to have declining marginal utility, there is strong theoretical reason to believe that more can be achieved by focusing on the global poor than by focusing on people who are already well-off. Given the extent of global inequality, William MacAskill, one of the founders of the effective altruist movement, calculates that those living in rich countries can reasonably expect to do one hundred times more for someone who is living in extreme poverty than they could by spending that money on themselves.

There are a number of practical steps [effective altruists] could take to make the movement more inclusive. For example, they could treat equality and priority as tie-breaking principles in cases where the outcome of welfare-based analysis is indeterminate. Given that their first-order estimations of impact invariably contain some margin for error, and that there is instrumental reason to prefer more equal distributions of resources, there is little
reason not to go down this path. In a similar vein, effective altruists could conduct a rights audit of the interventions they recommend, to see if the preferred policies impose serious
harms on individuals or groups. Here, too, there is general reason to avoid these outcomes. Welfare-based calculations that require these trade-offs should therefore be subject to additional scrutiny.","How do effective altruists address concerns about equality and justice, especially when these values might sometimes seem in tension with maximizing welfare?","
Effective altruists address concerns about equality and justice through several interconnected approaches, recognizing that these values are both instrumentally important and sometimes in tension with straightforward welfare maximization.
First, many effective altruists acknowledge that equality has significant instrumental value. They recognize that highly unequal distributions of resources can generate negative consequences including social resentment, political domination, and the erosion of public goods that benefit everyone. These instrumental concerns about inequality are entirely compatible with a focus on maximizing overall welfare.
Second, effective altruists often point out that their global perspective actually represents a radical commitment to equality when viewed from a broader lens. By treating all lives as equally valuable regardless of nationality, geographic location, or other arbitrary factors, effective altruism challenges the profound inequalities in how resources are typically distributed worldwide.
This global perspective connects directly to one of the most powerful arguments in effective altruism: the concept of declining marginal utility of money. Because additional resources typically produce much greater wellbeing improvements for those with very little, focusing on helping the global poor often represents both an equality-enhancing and welfare-maximizing approach. William MacAskill, a founder of the effective altruist movement, calculates that those living in wealthy countries can reasonably expect to do one hundred times more good for someone living in extreme poverty than they could by spending that same money on themselves.
That said, effective altruists recognize that sometimes welfare maximization and other values like equality or justice might appear to conflict. In these cases, several approaches can help address these tensions:
Equality as a tiebreaker: Effective altruists could treat equality and priority for the worst-off as tie-breaking principles in cases where welfare-based analysis is inconclusive. Since impact estimates inevitably contain margins of error, and there are instrumental reasons to prefer more equal distributions, this approach incorporates equality considerations without abandoning evidence-based methods.
Rights audits: The movement could systematically evaluate whether recommended interventions might impose serious harms on individuals or groups, even while increasing aggregate welfare. This would acknowledge the importance of rights and justice alongside consequentialist calculations.
Additional scrutiny for welfare-harm tradeoffs: When welfare-based calculations suggest accepting significant harms to some individuals to benefit others, these conclusions should receive particularly careful examination. This recognizes the moral importance of avoiding harm, not just promoting benefits.

Effective altruists address concerns about equality and justice through several interconnected approaches, recognizing that these values are both instrumentally important and sometimes in tension with straightforward welfare maximization.
First, many effective altruists acknowledge that equality has significant instrumental value. They recognize that highly unequal distributions of resources can generate negative consequences including social resentment, political domination, and the erosion of public goods that benefit everyone. These instrumental concerns about inequality are entirely compatible with a focus on maximizing overall welfare.
Second, effective altruists often point out that their global perspective actually represents a radical commitment to equality when viewed from a broader lens. By treating all lives as equally valuable regardless of nationality, geographic location, or other arbitrary factors, effective altruism challenges the profound inequalities in how resources are typically distributed worldwide.
This global perspective connects directly to one of the most powerful arguments in effective altruism: the concept of declining marginal utility of money. Because additional resources typically produce much greater wellbeing improvements for those with very little, focusing on helping the global poor often represents both an equality-enhancing and welfare-maximizing approach. William MacAskill, a founder of the effective altruist movement, calculates that those living in wealthy countries can reasonably expect to do one hundred times more good for someone living in extreme poverty than they could by spending that same money on themselves.
That said, effective altruists recognize that sometimes welfare maximization and other values like equality or justice might appear to conflict. In these cases, several approaches can help address these tensions:
Equality as a tiebreaker: Effective altruists could treat equality and priority for the worst-off as tie-breaking principles in cases where welfare-based analysis is inconclusive. Since impact estimates inevitably contain margins of error, and there are instrumental reasons to prefer more equal distributions, this approach incorporates equality considerations without abandoning evidence-based methods.
Rights audits: The movement could systematically evaluate whether recommended interventions might impose serious harms on individuals or groups, even while increasing aggregate welfare. This would acknowledge the importance of rights and justice alongside consequentialist calculations.
Additional scrutiny for welfare-harm tradeoffs: When welfare-based calculations suggest accepting significant harms to some individuals to benefit others, these conclusions should receive particularly careful examination. This recognizes the moral importance of avoiding harm, not just promoting benefits.
Expanded conceptions of wellbeing: Some effective altruists work with broader conceptions of wellbeing that already incorporate concerns about equality, autonomy, and rights. These approaches don't treat equality as strictly separate from welfare.
Moral uncertainty: Many effective altruists acknowledge uncertainty about which moral frameworks are correct and adopt approaches that perform reasonably well across multiple plausible moral theories, including those that place special emphasis on equality or justice.

“Effective Altruism and Its Critics” Jason Gabriel,Peer-Reviewed Paper,Objection,Priority,"Although the declining marginal utility of money encourages effective altruists to focus on helping poor people, in practice, the most cost-effective interventions are unlikely to be those that focus on the poorest of the poor.

The concern, as articulated by Jason Gabriel in his paper ""Effective Altruism and Its Critics,"" points to a potential systematic blind spot in how effective altruists evaluate interventions.
At its core, this critique suggests that EA's strong preference for rigorous, quantifiable evidence—particularly from RCTs—may unintentionally bias the movement toward certain types of interventions while overlooking others that might be equally or more effective but harder to measure with these methods.
The Observational Bias Problem
Gabriel notes that ""overreliance on RCTs may have led effective altruists to overlook high-impact activities like campaigning."" This reflects a fundamental tension in impact evaluation: interventions that produce direct, immediate, and easily measurable outcomes (like distributing malaria nets) lend themselves well to RCT evaluation, while those with complex, diffuse, or long-term effects (like policy advocacy or institutional reform) often don't.
This methodological preference appears to influence which causes receive attention and funding. Gabriel points out that ""all but one of the 'top charities' recommended by GiveWell and Giving What We Can focus on treating neglected tropical diseases, an area where evidence drawn from RCTs is plentiful."" This concentration isn't necessarily because these interventions have the highest impact of all possible interventions, but rather because their impacts are the most amenable to measurement through RCTs.
Implications for Cause Prioritization
This methodological bias can shape the EA landscape in several important ways:
First, entire categories of potentially high-impact work may receive less attention within EA because they don't fit neatly into the RCT evaluation model. Policy advocacy, institutional reform, movement building, scientific research, and systemic change initiatives all face this challenge. These approaches might create enormous positive change but through causal pathways that are too complex or long-term to capture in an RCT.
Second, organizations working in these less easily measured domains face a structural disadvantage. As Gabriel argues, ""by asking charities to demonstrate their impact in these terms, effective altruists risk setting them up to fail."" A charity working on legal reform to prevent human rights abuses might create tremendous value, but without RCT evidence, they may struggle to gain recognition within EA evaluation frameworks.
Third, this bias can contribute to conservatism in EA funding patterns. Novel approaches or interventions in emerging fields might lack rigorous evidence precisely because they're new or operating in contexts where gathering such evidence is difficult. This could lead to an overemphasis on established, well-studied interventions at the expense of potentially more innovative ones.
Responsibility and Moving Forward
Gabriel emphasizes that effective altruists have taken on a significant responsibility by positioning themselves as arbiters of effectiveness. He argues that the movement has ""a responsibility to ensure that its standards can be met across a range of high-impact areas and to advise those they evaluate about how this can be done.""
Without addressing this methodological challenge, EA risks ""ignoring useful interventions, which cannot be assessed according to their methods, and causing unwarranted reputational damage to organizations working outside their focus areas.""
This critique doesn't invalidate EA's commitment to evidence-based giving, but rather suggests the need for a more nuanced, diverse epistemological approach. Several important developments within EA are already working to address this concern:
Expanding evaluation methods: Many EA organizations now complement RCTs with other approaches like quasi-experimental designs, observational studies, expert opinion aggregation, and theory-based evaluation.
Hits-based giving: Organizations like Open Philanthropy explicitly pursue ""hits-based giving"" that accepts higher uncertainty and less rigorous evidence for interventions with potentially enormous upsides.
Cause-specific frameworks: Recognizing that different causes require different evaluation approaches, EA researchers are developing frameworks tailored to areas like policy advocacy, longtermism, and animal welfare.
Value of information: More emphasis is being placed on funding research that could reduce uncertainty about promising but understudied interventions.
When thinking about EA's methodological approach to evidence, it may be helpful to distinguish between ""most effective"" and ""most demonstrably effective given current evidence."" This distinction acknowledges that our current knowledge has limitations, and the interventions we can prove are effective today may not represent the complete set of highly effective options.
This perspective encourages a balanced approach that maintains EA's commitment to evidence while remaining open to promising interventions that don't yet have—or perhaps cannot have—the same level of empirical support. It also supports reasonable risk-taking on high-impact but less certain interventions alongside investments in well-evidenced approaches.
The evolution of EA's approach to evidence and evaluation reflects the movement's commitment to self-critique and improvement. By engaging seriously with methodological limitations and working to address them, effective altruism can develop more comprehensive frameworks that identify truly high-impact opportunities across a wider range of causes and approaches.","{

Limitations of Single-Metric Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
Several challenges emerge when relying too heavily on metrics like DALYs:
Value Judgment Opacity: DALYs embed specific value judgments—such as how to weigh different disabilities or how to compare impacts across different age groups—that may not be universally shared or explicitly acknowledged.
Measurement Challenges: Many important outcomes resist straightforward quantification. How do we measure improvements in institutional quality, enhanced capabilities, or long-term systemic changes? These can be critically important but don't neatly fit into DALY calculations.
Data Quality Issues: Cost-effectiveness analyses often rely on limited or imperfect data, especially in resource-constrained settings where rigorous studies are less common.
Uncertainty Underrepresentation: Point estimates of cost-effectiveness can create a false sense of precision. The range of possible outcomes often spans several orders of magnitude, but this uncertainty is frequently compressed into a single number.
Indirect Effects Exclusion: Traditional metrics often struggle to capture complex, indirect, or long-term effects, including spillover benefits, system-level changes, and enabling factors that might amplify other interventions.
GiveWell's Evolution in Approach
GiveWell, one of EA's most influential charity evaluators, has indeed moved beyond simple cost-effectiveness metrics. Their adaptation includes:
Multiple Lines of Evidence: As noted in your source, GiveWell now explicitly seeks conclusions ""supported by multiple different lines of analysis, as unrelated to one another as possible."" This methodological triangulation helps overcome the limitations of any single approach.
Moral Weights: Rather than using standard DALY weights, GiveWell developed its own ""moral weights"" framework that explicitly acknowledges the value judgments inherent in comparing different outcomes (like saving a child's life versus increasing income).
Explicit Uncertainty Analysis: Their evaluations now feature more prominent discussions of uncertainty, including sensitivity analyses that show how conclusions might change under different assumptions.
Qualitative Factors: GiveWell increasingly incorporates factors that resist quantification, such as organizational strength, intervention robustness across contexts, and potential for learning.
Broader Impact Consideration: Beyond immediate health impacts, GiveWell has expanded to consider economic benefits, empowerment effects, and institutional improvements that might flow from interventions.
The Current Landscape
Today's most sophisticated EA evaluations tend to:
Use quantitative metrics as one important input rather than the sole decision factor
Explicitly state the moral assumptions underlying their comparisons
Present ranges rather than point estimates for cost-effectiveness
Consider scenario analysis for different value systems
Include qualitative assessments alongside numerical estimates
This evolution reflects EA's maturation as a movement.

“Effective Altruism and Its Critics” Jason Gabriel,Peer-Reviewed Paper,Objection,Counterfactual,"A central claim of effective altruism is that for a person’s action to have impact, it must also be the case that her contribution would not have been made by someone else if she had chosen to act differently. This type of counterfactual analysis explains their preference for neglected causes. It also explains their claim that it is usually better to choose a high-income career and donate a sizable portion of one’s income to an effective charity than it is to
work for a charity oneself

Yet, this observation also raises doubts about the overall impact
of donating to their recommended organizations. he
effective altruist community now contains a diverse set of actors, ranging from college students and young professionals to large philanthropic organizations who have billions of dollars to spend. Bearing this in mind, we should ask what would happen if a smaller donor were to stop giving. Would larger donors simply fill the gap? … Giving to these organizations simply makes additional funds available to larger foundations that are already flush with cash.","I've heard effective altruists talk about ""counterfactual reasoning"" when evaluating career choices and donations. Can you explain what this means and why it matters for making an impact?","Counterfactual reasoning is a fundamental concept in effective altruism that helps us determine our true impact by comparing what actually happens when we take an action against what would have happened otherwise. This approach reveals the net difference we make in the world.
To understand counterfactual impact, imagine you're considering two options:
First, you could volunteer at a local food bank where there's already a waiting list of eager volunteers. If you don't show up, someone else will immediately take your place and perform the same tasks with similar effectiveness.
Second, you could volunteer with a newer, understaffed refugee support organization where your skills are urgently needed and no replacement would step in if you declined.
Though both options involve helping others, the counterfactual impact of the second choice is substantially higher. Your contribution to the refugee organization creates value that wouldn't exist without you, while your contribution to the food bank largely replaces value that would have existed anyway.
This reasoning extends to many EA decisions:
When evaluating career paths, it's important to consider not just the direct good you do in a role, but what would have happened if someone else had taken that position instead. This is why some effective altruists recommend pursuing high-earning careers outside the nonprofit sector to donate substantially — the counterfactual impact of your donations may exceed the counterfactual impact of working directly at a charity where someone else might have done similar work.
For donations, counterfactual thinking helps identify truly neglected opportunities. If large foundations will eventually fund a certain intervention anyway, your donation might create more value directed elsewhere.
However, counterfactual reasoning also raises challenging questions for the EA community itself. As the movement grows and includes more large donors, smaller contributors might wonder if their donations to popular EA causes make a difference when larger funders could fill any gaps. This is an ongoing discussion within EA circles.
While we can never predict counterfactual scenarios with complete certainty, this mode of thinking remains valuable for improving our decisions. It pushes us to consider the unique difference we can make rather than just the direct good of our actions. When making important choices, asking ""What would happen if I didn't do this?"" often reveals surprising insights about where your efforts can create the greatest additional benefit.

Probablygood.org,Website,ITN,Framework,"You’ll see that the three factors often trade off against each other. For example, areas that are important and tractable tend to be less neglected. There’s no single ‘top’ cause area that’s right for everyone, and it’s okay to work in an area or pursue a role that isn’t ‘perfect’ along all three metrics! 
This is a general framework for making imprecise observations—it won’t spit out an infallible answer. There are other methodologies out there, and many (e.g. limiting factors) can be incredibly useful in some circumstances. 
In the context of career decisions, it’s also worth noting that a cause’s impact is just one consideration. It’s important to keep in mind that your skills, experience and even your excitement about specific causes can be a deciding factor for you in the cause area you’ll eventually choose.
","I've heard about the Importance, Tractability, Neglectedness (ITN) framework for evaluating causes, but I've also heard that these factors often involve tradeoffs. How should I think about these tradeoffs when trying to choose which cause to work on?","The Importance, Tractability, Neglectedness (ITN) framework provides a structured way to evaluate cause areas, but you're right that these factors often involve tradeoffs that require nuanced thinking. Understanding these tradeoffs can help you make more informed decisions about where to direct your efforts.
The most common tradeoff occurs between importance and neglectedness. Causes that are widely recognized as important—like climate change, education, or global health—tend to attract substantial resources and attention. This means they're typically less neglected than causes that might seem more niche or speculative. Conversely, highly neglected areas often remain that way precisely because fewer people recognize their importance or feasibility.
Consider global health versus wild animal welfare. Global health has clear, widely acknowledged importance and proven interventions, but it also receives billions in funding annually. Wild animal welfare might affect trillions of beings but remains highly neglected partly because its importance isn't as widely accepted and tractable solutions are less obvious.
Tractability and neglectedness also frequently trade off against each other. As solutions to a problem become more demonstrably effective (increasing tractability), more resources typically flow into the area (decreasing neglectedness). Areas that remain highly neglected often do so because effective interventions haven't been clearly established.
These tradeoffs mean there's rarely a single ""top"" cause area that dominates across all three metrics. Instead, different cause areas present different profiles of strengths and weaknesses:
Some causes, like global health, score very high on importance and tractability but lower on neglectedness.
Others, like risks from artificial intelligence, might score extremely high on importance and neglectedness but have more uncertain tractability.
Still others, like animal welfare, might have clear interventions (tractability) addressing vast amounts of suffering (importance) but receive relatively little attention (neglectedness).
When navigating these tradeoffs, several considerations can help:
First, recognize that the ITN framework provides a general structure for thinking rather than a precise formula. It helps you make imprecise observations and comparisons, not calculate definitive rankings.
Second, remember that personal fit matters alongside these three factors. Your skills, experience, and genuine interest in a cause area can dramatically affect your potential impact. Working on a cause that perfectly aligns with your capabilities might ultimately allow for greater impact than working on a theoretically ""better"" cause where you're less well-suited to contribute.
Third, consider using other complementary frameworks. For instance, the ""limiting factors"" approach asks what resources (talent, money, attention) a cause area most needs right now. This can help identify where your particular contributions might be most valuable.
Fourth, acknowledge that uncertainty is inevitable in these assessments. Being open to updating your views as new information emerges is more important than feeling certain you've found the ""right"" cause.
Finally, remember that working on a cause that isn't perfectly optimized across all three metrics is still valuable. The difference between doing nothing and working on any promising cause area is typically much larger than the difference between working on a good cause and the theoretical ""best"" cause.
The most thoughtful effective altruists recognize that cause selection involves complex judgment calls rather than simple calculations. By understanding the natural tradeoffs between importance, tractability, and neglectedness, you can make more informed decisions while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in trying to do the most good.","{

Probablygood.org,Website,Career Choice,SELF Framework,"The SELF Framework is a straightforward tool to help assess a role’s potential for making a real difference. Here’s a summary of the four key factors to consider:

S – Significance of the problem
E – Efficacy of the method or intervention
L – Leverage of your specific role within the problem
F – Fit of your strengths & interests for the job
","I'm trying to decide between several career options and have heard about the ""SELF Framework"" in effective altruism. Could you explain how this framework works and how I might apply it to evaluate different career paths?","The SELF Framework is an excellent tool for evaluating career options through an effective altruism lens while also accounting for personal factors. It examines four key dimensions that together determine a role's potential for meaningful impact.
Let me break down each component and show how you might apply them in your career decision-making:
S – Significance of the problem
This element focuses on the scale and importance of the issue you'll be addressing. Ask yourself:
How many people are affected by this problem?
How severely does it impact their lives?
Does it affect future generations?
Is it a recognized priority within effective altruism (like global health, existential risk, animal welfare, or extreme poverty)?
For example, working on malaria prevention addresses a problem that affects millions of lives and has clear metrics for improvement. Similarly, climate change or AI safety work involves significant long-term global stakes.
E – Efficacy of the method or intervention
This component evaluates how well the approach actually works at solving the problem. Consider:
Is there strong evidence supporting this intervention?
What does research say about its cost-effectiveness?
Are there rigorous evaluations of outcomes?
Is there room for improvement in current methods?
For instance, distributing insecticide-treated bed nets has substantial evidence supporting its effectiveness in preventing malaria, while some educational interventions have more mixed results despite good intentions.
L – Leverage of your specific role
This examines how much influence your particular position will have on implementing solutions. Questions include:
How many resources will you direct or influence?
Will your work enable or multiply the impact of others?
Does the role provide unique decision-making authority?
Is this a high-need position that would otherwise go unfilled?
A program director allocating millions in funding may have more leverage than a front-line worker in the same organization. Alternatively, being the first AI safety researcher at a major lab might have substantial leverage despite not managing others.
F – Fit of your strengths & interests for the job
The final component acknowledges that personal compatibility is crucial for long-term impact. Reflect on:
Do your skills and talents align with the role's requirements?
Will you find the work engaging and sustainable?
Can you excel and advance in this field?
Will this role support your well-being and prevent burnout?
Even the most impactful role on paper won't create lasting good if you can't perform effectively or will leave quickly due to poor fit.
Applying the Framework
When evaluating career options, you might create a simple scoring system for each dimension on a 1-5 scale:
For each option, score the Significance of the problem addressed
Score the Efficacy of the intervention or approach
Score the Leverage your specific role would provide
Score your personal Fit for the position
While you might weight certain factors more heavily depending on your values, roles scoring well across all four dimensions often represent the strongest opportunities for impact.
The SELF Framework acknowledges that impact isn't one-dimensional. A seemingly less significant problem where you have exceptional fit and leverage might ultimately allow for greater contribution than a theoretically important cause where you'd struggle to be effective.
Remember that this framework is a guide rather than a rigid formula. Use it to structure your thinking while recognizing that career decisions involve complex considerations beyond what any single model can capture.

Probablygood.org,Website,Diminishing Returns,Framework,"Sometimes, investing more resources—whether it’s money, time, or effort—produces diminishing benefits. For instance, the first dollar you spend on something is often far more useful than the thousandth dollar. This concept, known as diminishing returns, plays a crucial role in evaluating the potential of various opportunities.

Consider the 80/20 rule: the first 20% of effort often produces 80% of the results, while the remaining 80% of work focuses on less impactful details.
Similarly, when comparing product prices, the difference between a $20 phone and a $120 phone is significant—like whether or not the phone will work in a few months. However, the difference between a $1,000 phone and a $1,100 phone may be minimal.

However, it’s important to keep in mind that this phenomenon doesn’t apply in all cases. One effect that can sometimes counteract diminishing returns is economies of scale, where organizations become more efficient the larger their operations become. In these cases, careful analysis is required to estimate whether future investments will be more or less cost-effective than past ones.
","I've been donating to the same effective charity for several years. Recently, I've noticed they're receiving much more funding from large foundations. Should I continue donating to them or redirect my giving elsewhere? How does effective altruism think about diminishing returns in charitable giving?","This is an excellent question that touches on several important concepts in effective altruism: diminishing returns, marginal impact, and funding gaps. Your observation about your charity receiving increased support from large foundations shows thoughtful attention to the changing landscape of charitable giving.
Diminishing returns is a core economic concept that applies powerfully to charitable donations. As a cause or organization receives more funding, typically:
The most cost-effective opportunities get funded first
Each additional dollar tends to produce less impact than the previous one
Eventually, an organization may reach a point where it has sufficient funding for its most valuable projects
Let me illustrate with an example: Imagine a global health organization that initially uses donations to distribute bed nets in high-malaria regions (very cost-effective). As they receive more funding, they might expand to moderately-affected regions (somewhat less cost-effective), and eventually to education programs or administrative improvements (potentially much less cost-effective than the core intervention).
When a charity you've supported begins receiving substantial funding from large foundations, several considerations become relevant:
Room for more funding: Investigate whether the organization still has high-impact opportunities that remain unfunded. Many effective charities publish detailed analyses of their funding gaps and what additional money would accomplish. GiveWell, for instance, regularly updates its estimates of how much more funding their top charities could productively use.
Comparative advantage: Large foundations often have different priorities and constraints than individual donors. They might fund only certain programs or require specific reporting. Your more flexible donation might still fill important gaps that institutional funders overlook.
New opportunities: The effective altruism community continuously researches emerging high-impact opportunities. Causes that were overlooked a few years ago might now represent better giving opportunities than well-established charities. Organizations like Giving What We Can and Open Philanthropy regularly update their recommendations based on new evidence.
Diversification: There's value in maintaining a diverse donor base for charities. If all funding comes from a few large foundations, organizations become vulnerable to sudden shifts in those foundations' priorities.
When making your decision, I'd recommend:
Contacting the charity directly to ask about their current funding needs and how they view the impact of additional donations given their increased foundation support
Investigating whether there are newer, more neglected opportunities within the same cause area that might now have higher marginal impact
Considering whether to split your donation between continuing support for your current charity and exploring promising but less well-funded interventions
The fact that you're asking this question reflects the kind of thoughtful giving that effective altruism encourages. While there's no universal answer – sometimes staying the course is best, other times redirecting makes more sense – applying these principles of diminishing returns and marginal thinking will help you maximize the impact of your generosity.

Probablygood.org,Website,Marginal Impact,Framework,"Marginal impact refers to the additional difference your specific investment of time, money, or effort makes. Rather than focusing on the total impact of an organization or movement, it’s about recognizing how much your contribution adds to what’s already being done. This way, you can better decide where to direct your resources for the greatest effect.

","Some effective altruists seem very devoted to cause neutrality, while others focus deeply on specific areas like global health or AI safety. Is cause neutrality really important for being an effective altruist? What are the advantages and limitations of this approach?","Cause neutrality is an important principle within effective altruism, but its practical application is more nuanced than it might initially appear. Let me explain both the concept and its real-world complexities.
At its core, cause neutrality means being open to directing resources toward whatever cause will create the most positive impact, rather than selecting causes based on personal connection, emotional appeal, or tradition. This approach aims to overcome cognitive biases that might lead us toward less effective interventions—like preferring to help people who look like us or focusing only on problems we've personally witnessed.
The primary advantages of cause neutrality include:
Avoiding arbitrarily limited thinking. By considering a wide range of possible causes, we're more likely to identify truly high-impact opportunities that might otherwise be overlooked.
Enabling meaningful comparisons. Cause neutrality provides a framework for comparing quite different interventions—like education programs versus climate change mitigation—using common metrics such as lives improved or suffering prevented.
Reducing bias in resource allocation. It helps counter our tendency to favor causes that are emotionally compelling, culturally prominent, or personally meaningful regardless of their actual impact potential.
Promoting innovation in philanthropy. By evaluating causes based on impact rather than tradition, cause neutrality encourages exploration of novel approaches and neglected areas.
However, cause neutrality also has practical limitations and challenges:
Incomplete information. We never have perfect data on all possible interventions, making truly neutral comparisons difficult. The evidence basis differs dramatically across cause areas.
Value pluralism. Comparing across vastly different domains (like animal welfare versus existential risk) ultimately requires value judgments about which types of impact matter more.
Comparative advantage. Individual effective altruists often have specialized knowledge, skills, or connections that make them particularly effective in specific areas. Perfect cause neutrality might ignore these personal factors.
Diminishing returns to exploration. There are cognitive costs to constantly reevaluating all possible causes. At some point, it becomes more productive to develop expertise in specific areas.
In practice, most thoughtful effective altruists occupy a middle ground. They begin with cause-neutral exploration to identify promising areas, then often specialize while maintaining openness to major updates. Organizations like Open Philanthropy exemplify this approach—they have cause-specific teams but maintain cause-neutral mechanisms for comparing across portfolios and adjusting resource allocation.
For individual effective altruists, a realistic approach might be:
Start with broad, cause-neutral exploration to identify the areas where you can potentially create the most impact
Consider your personal fit factors, including skills, knowledge, and sustainability
Develop deeper expertise in one or a few promising cause areas
Periodically revisit your cause prioritization with an open mind
Maintain connection with the broader EA community to stay aware of emerging evidence about other causes
This balanced approach recognizes that cause neutrality is a valuable ideal that shapes our thinking, even if perfect neutrality isn't practically achievable or necessarily optimal for everyone. The key is allowing your cause selection to be guided by evidence and impact potential rather than arbitrary preferences, while acknowledging the legitimate role that personal factors play in sustained, effective action.

Organizations like Open Philanthropy exemplify this approach—they have cause-specific teams but maintain cause-neutral mechanisms for comparing across portfolios and adjusting resource allocation.
For individual effective altruists, a realistic approach might be:
Start with broad, cause-neutral exploration to identify the areas where you can potentially create the most impact
Consider your personal fit factors, including skills, knowledge, and sustainability
Develop deeper expertise in one or a few promising cause areas
Periodically revisit your cause prioritization with an open mind
Maintain connection with the broader EA community to stay aware of emerging evidence about other causes
This balanced approach recognizes that cause neutrality is a valuable ideal that shapes our thinking, even if perfect neutrality isn't practically achievable or necessarily optimal for everyone. The key is allowing your cause selection to be guided by evidence and impact potential rather than arbitrary preferences, while acknowledging the legitimate role that personal factors play in sustained, effective action.

Probablygood.org,Website,Counterfactual,Framework,"Counterfactual impact is the difference you make by doing something versus what would have happened if you hadn’t done it. For example, if you help someone in need but simply replace someone else who would have done the same, your counterfactual impact is minimal because the person would have received help regardless.

We will usually not be able to estimate the full counterfactual impact of our decisions reliably. However, taking into account counterfactual considerations where these are clear and significant can still help us make better career decisions—or at least avoid some common pitfalls.",What is 'counterfactual impact' and why is it an important concept in effective altruism? How might thinking counterfactually change how I evaluate potential career choices or donation opportunities?,"Counterfactual impact is a fundamental concept in effective altruism that refers to the difference between what happens when you take a particular action and what would have happened if you hadn't taken that action. It's essentially asking: ""What unique difference am I making that wouldn't have occurred otherwise?""
This concept is crucial because it helps us distinguish between actions that appear impactful on the surface and those that truly create additional good in the world. Consider a simple example: if you help someone in need but are merely replacing another person who would have provided the exact same help, your counterfactual impact is minimal. The person would have received help regardless of your actions. Your true impact is the difference between the world with your contribution and the world without it.
Thinking counterfactually transforms how we evaluate our choices in several important ways:
For career decisions, counterfactual thinking raises critical questions about replaceability. If you take a job at an effective organization, the counterfactual impact depends on who would have filled the role otherwise. If someone equally qualified would have taken the position and performed similarly, your counterfactual impact from taking that specific job might be small. This doesn't mean the job itself isn't impactful—it means your unique contribution comes from doing something that wouldn't otherwise happen.
This insight often leads effective altruists to consider less conventional career paths. Rather than joining organizations where many qualified candidates compete for positions, you might create more counterfactual impact by:
Bringing effective altruist principles into fields or organizations where they're underrepresented
Creating entirely new organizations or initiatives that wouldn't exist without you
Building unusual skill combinations that allow you to fill roles few others could
Working on neglected problems where additional talent makes a substantial difference
For donations, counterfactual thinking helps identify opportunities where your contribution genuinely increases resources for important causes rather than simply replacing other donations. Key considerations include:
Funding gaps: Organizations or projects that would scale back activities without your donation offer higher counterfactual impact than fully-funded initiatives.
Matching programs: These can increase counterfactual impact if they truly bring in donations that wouldn't have happened otherwise (though many matching programs don't actually work this way).
Timing: Being an early supporter of promising projects can have higher counterfactual impact by helping them reach critical thresholds or demonstrate viability to larger funders.
Neglected causes: Areas receiving little attention from other donors typically offer higher counterfactual impact since your contribution is less likely to substitute for someone else's.
Counterfactual thinking also affects how we evaluate coordination with others. Sometimes the highest impact comes not from individual action but from coordinating with others to achieve outcomes that wouldn't happen if everyone acted independently. This perspective has led effective altruists to create donor coordination mechanisms and career advising services that help people find opportunities for greater counterfactual impact.
It's important to acknowledge that we can rarely predict counterfactual outcomes with certainty. Complex systems and unknown variables make perfect counterfactual analysis impossible. However, even rough counterfactual thinking helps us avoid common pitfalls and identify opportunities where our actions are more likely to make a genuine difference.
By incorporating counterfactual thinking into your decision-making, you shift from asking ""Does this action do good?"" to the more precise question of ""Does this action do good that wouldn't have happened otherwise?"" This perspective doesn't diminish the value of conventional paths—many standard careers and donations do create substantial counterfactual impact—but it helps identify less obvious opportunities where your unique contribution might create even more value in the world.","{

Probablygood.org,Website,Cause Neutrality,Framework,"Cause neutrality is the effort to remain impartial and open-minded when deciding which causes to prioritize. While true neutrality is difficult, supporters of cause neutrality aim to avoid getting attached to “pet causes” or limiting themselves to a narrow field. Instead, they focus on exploring a broad range of causes and choosing based on what will create the most impact, rather than personal preference or irrelevant considerations.

We tend to favor people geographically and culturally similar to us. But these biases can lead us away from the most effective causes in terms of real-world impact. Instead, cause neutrality encourages us to stay open and explore the best opportunities for creating the greatest change.","What is 'cause neutrality' in effective altruism, and why might it be both valuable and challenging to implement in practice? How does it differ from how most people typically approach charitable giving?","Cause neutrality is a distinctive approach in effective altruism that involves remaining impartial and open-minded when deciding which causes to prioritize. Rather than beginning with predetermined cause areas, a cause-neutral approach attempts to compare diverse problems based on their potential for impact, using consistent criteria across completely different domains.
This approach stands in stark contrast to how most people typically approach charitable giving. Traditional philanthropy often starts with personal connection—people donate to fight diseases that affected loved ones, support their alma maters, contribute to local community initiatives, or give to causes that align with their political or religious identities. These connections create powerful motivation but can lead to inconsistent impact across different charitable efforts.
Cause neutrality attempts to transcend these personal attachments by asking: ""Where can my resources do the most good, regardless of my personal connections or preferences?"" This might lead to supporting interventions in global health, animal welfare, existential risk reduction, or other areas based solely on their expected impact rather than emotional resonance.
The value of cause neutrality comes from several sources:
First, it helps overcome powerful cognitive biases that limit our effectiveness. We naturally favor those geographically and culturally similar to ourselves, but these biases can lead us away from the most impactful opportunities. For instance, the cost-effectiveness of life-saving interventions can differ by orders of magnitude between high-income and low-income countries, but without cause neutrality, we might never seriously consider opportunities beyond our immediate community.
Second, it enables more rational resource allocation. By comparing across cause areas using consistent metrics (such as lives saved, suffering prevented, or wellbeing improved), we can identify opportunities where marginal resources create substantially more impact than others.
Third, it encourages intellectual exploration. Maintaining cause neutrality means continually reassessing our priorities as new evidence emerges or new opportunities arise, rather than becoming locked into particular cause areas through emotional attachment or institutional inertia.
However, implementing cause neutrality presents significant challenges:
True neutrality is psychologically difficult, if not impossible. We all bring values, experiences, and intuitions that shape how we evaluate causes, even when attempting to remain neutral. Complete impartiality would require abandoning deeply held convictions about what matters.
Comparing across radically different domains involves challenging measurement problems. How do we objectively compare preventing human suffering, protecting animal welfare, and safeguarding future generations? Any framework for comparison necessarily embeds value judgments that could be considered non-neutral.
Cause neutrality can sometimes dampen motivation and community-building. The personal connections that cause neutrality seeks to transcend are often what drive sustained commitment and inspire others to join movements for change.
The limitations of available information make perfect cause neutrality impossible in practice. We inevitably must make decisions with incomplete evidence, and these information gaps may be filled with implicit biases.
Given these challenges, effective altruists often practice a form of constrained cause neutrality—striving for impartiality within the limitations of human psychology and available information. This might involve:
Regularly reassessing cause priorities rather than becoming permanently attached to specific areas Developing frameworks that attempt to make cross-cause comparisons more transparent and consistent Acknowledging and examining the values that inevitably influence how we weigh different types of impact Being open to shifting resources when compelling evidence suggests greater impact in another area
In practice, the most thoughtful effective altruists recognize cause neutrality as an aspiration rather than a perfectly achievable state. The goal isn't to eliminate all personal values or connections from decision-making, but rather to prevent these factors from inadvertently leading us away from opportunities to create much greater positive impact.

,,Effective Funding,Application,,"I have $10,000 to donate and am considering splitting it between global health charities and climate change initiatives. How would an effective altruist approach this decision process?","I'll walk you through how an effective altruist would approach this donation decision, demonstrating the concrete analysis process rather than just describing it conceptually.
Step 1: Establish a framework for comparison
First, we need a systematic way to compare these different cause areas. Let's use the ITN framework (Importance, Tractability, Neglectedness) while considering the expected impact per dollar in each area.
Step 2: Gather evidence on global health interventions
For global health, we have robust data from GiveWell's analysis. Let's look at their top recommendations:
Against Malaria Foundation (AMF): Distributes insecticide-treated nets in malaria-endemic regions
Cost per life saved equivalent: ~$4,500
Evidence quality: Very strong (multiple randomized controlled trials)
Room for more funding: Currently estimated at $30-40 million
Malaria Consortium's seasonal malaria chemoprevention program:
Cost per life saved equivalent: ~$4,200
Evidence quality: Very strong
Room for more funding: $15-25 million
These interventions have been extensively studied and show consistent results across different contexts. The cost-effectiveness estimates are relatively precise with narrow confidence intervals.
Step 3: Gather evidence on climate change interventions
For climate change, let's examine some top-rated interventions:
Clean Air Task Force (CATF): Policy advocacy for clean energy technologies
Estimated cost per ton of CO₂ averted: $1-10
Evidence quality: Moderate (difficult to definitively attribute policy changes)
Leverage potential: Very high (each dollar can influence much larger government/private spending)
Coalition for Rainforest Nations: Supports tropical forest conservation
Estimated cost per ton of CO₂ averted: $0.12-$0.72
Evidence quality: Moderate (complex attribution chains)
Track record: Has contributed to policies preventing deforestation
The climate interventions typically show wider confidence intervals in their impact estimates due to the complex causality involved.
Step 4: Compare impact metrics across domains
Now comes the challenging part – comparing different types of impact. We'll need to consider:
The time horizons (global health benefits are immediate; climate benefits are long-term)
The certainty of impact (global health has more definitive evidence)
The types of benefits (saving lives now vs. preventing future suffering)
Let's try to quantify this in terms of expected value:
For global health, if you donated $10,000:
To AMF: Expected impact ≈ 2.2 lives saved equivalent (~$10,000 ÷ $4,500)
Confidence interval: Roughly 1.8-2.6 lives saved equivalent
For climate change, if you donated $10,000:
To Coalition for Rainforest Nations: Expected impact ≈ 13,888-83,333 tons of CO₂ averted ($10,000 ÷ $0.12 to $10,000 ÷ $0.72)
Confidence interval: Much wider due to attribution uncertainty
To make these comparable, we need a conversion factor. This requires philosophical assumptions about how to value:
Present vs. future benefits
Certainty vs. uncertainty of impact
Human vs. non-human impacts
Step 5: Consider personal factors and worldview uncertainties
Given the philosophical complexities, effective altruists often consider:
Moral weights: How much do you value long-term future impacts vs. present impacts? If you place equal weight on future people, climate change might rank higher. If you heavily discount the future, global health might rank higher.
Risk attitude: How do you handle uncertainty? If you're risk-averse, global health's more certain impacts might be preferable. If you're willing to accept higher uncertainty for higher expected value, climate might rank higher.
Worldview diversification: Given deep uncertainty, many effective altruists recommend allocating across worldviews.
Step 6: Develop a concrete allocation plan
Given these considerations, a reasonable approach might be:
Allocate 70% ($7,000) to the global health intervention with highest confidence (AMF or Malaria Consortium)
Allocate 30% ($3,000) to the climate intervention with best expected value (Coalition for Rainforest Nations)
Revisit this allocation annually as new evidence emerges
This distribution:
Achieves approximately 1.6 lives saved equivalent (70% of 2.2) through global health
Averts approximately 4,166-25,000 tons of CO₂ (30% of the calculated range)
Balances near-term and long-term impacts
Accounts for uncertainty by weighting more toward higher-confidence interventions
Step 7: Consider other factors before finalizing
Before finalizing, consider:
Recent funding flows: Has either cause received substantial new funding recently?
Personal fit: Do you have specialized knowledge that might make your contribution more valuable in one area?
Giving timing: Should you donate now or wait for more information?
This analysis demonstrates the systematic approach an effective altruist would take to allocate donations between cause areas, looking at concrete impact estimates, comparing different types of good, and making explicit the assumptions that influence the decision.","{

,,Career Choice,Application,,I'm trying to decide between pursuing a career in AI safety research versus earning to give in finance. How would you walk through an effective altruism career analysis for this decision?,"Let me walk you through a concrete effective altruism analysis for this career decision between AI safety research and earning to give in finance. Rather than just discussing theory, I'll demonstrate the actual reasoning process an effective altruist might use.
Step 1: Establish a framework for career impact
We'll analyze these options across four key dimensions:
Direct impact (the good done directly through your work)
Earnings potential (for donations)
Career capital (skills, credentials, connections gained)
Personal fit (likelihood of success and sustainability)
Step 2: Gather concrete impact estimates for AI safety research
Let's start with a direct work path in AI safety research:
Direct impact potential:
Problem scale: Potentially extreme (existential risk reduction)
Marginal contribution: Varies widely based on talent and breakthrough potential
Simplified expected value calculation:
Assumption: AI safety researcher has a 0.01% chance of making a contribution that reduces existential risk by 0.1%
If we value the long-term future at 10^16 expected future lives
Expected impact: 0.0001 × 0.001 × 10^16 = 10^9 expected lives influenced
Earnings potential for donations:
Academic track: $80,000-$150,000 (post-PhD)
Industry research track: $150,000-$400,000+
Donation potential (50% of post-tax income):
Academic: $25,000-$60,000/year
Industry: $60,000-$150,000+/year
Career capital:
Technical skills: Very high value, transferable to many domains
Network: High value in emerging field
Credentials: PhD or research publications highly valued
Options: Preserves paths to academia, industry, and policy
Personal fit factors to assess:
Mathematical aptitude (critical)
Research temperament (critical)
Comfort with uncertainty and long feedback loops (critical)
Required credentials: Usually PhD in relevant field
Field growth trajectory: Rapidly expanding
Step 3: Gather concrete impact estimates for finance (earning to give)
Now let's analyze the finance path:
Direct impact potential:
Problem scale: Varies by type of finance (can be negative in extractive roles)
Marginal contribution: Limited direct positive impact; potential negative externalities
Expected direct impact: Potentially net negative without careful role selection
Earnings potential for donations:
Entry level: $100,000-$150,000
Mid-career (5-10 years): $300,000-$800,000+
Donation potential (50% of post-tax income):
Early career: $40,000-$60,000/year
Mid-career: $120,000-$300,000+/year
Career capital:
Technical skills: Moderate value, somewhat transferable
Network: High value, especially for future fundraising
Credentials: Valuable in business sectors
Options: Preserves paths to business, entrepreneurship, and operations roles
Personal fit factors to assess:
Quantitative skills (important)
Work ethic and stress tolerance (critical)
Cultural fit with competitive environments (important)
Required credentials: Usually finance, economics, or STEM degree
Field stability: Well-established but cyclical
Step 4: Compare quantitative impact estimates
Let's directly compare the expected impact from donations versus direct work:
For finance (earning to give):
Mid-career annual donations: ~$200,000/year (middle estimate)
Effectiveness of donations: If directed to GiveWell top charities at ~$5,000/life saved equivalent
Annual impact: ~40 lives saved equivalent per year
Career impact (30-year career): ~1,200 lives saved equivalent
For AI safety research:
Expected impact: Much harder to quantify precisely
Orders-of-magnitude estimate from above: 10^9 expected lives influenced
Even if we discount this by 99.99% due to uncertainty, the expected value still exceeds the earning to give path
This comparison highlights a key challenge: comparing relatively certain, near-term benefits (donations to global health) with highly uncertain but potentially enormous long-term benefits (reducing existential risk).
Step 5: Factor in personal fit with concrete self-assessment
Now we need to adjust these impact estimates based on your personal fit. Rather than vague assessments, let's create a concrete framework:
Create a personal fit score for each path on a 0-10 scale across key dimensions:
Skills match (how well your abilities align with requirements)
Motivation sustainability (how likely you'll remain engaged long-term)
Competitive advantage (how you compare to others pursuing this path)
For example:
AI Safety Research fit assessment:
Skills: 7/10 (if you have strong technical background, adjust accordingly)
Motivation: 8/10 (if the intellectual challenges engage you deeply)
Competitive advantage: 5/10 (depends on your specific technical strengths)
Overall fit score: 6.7/10
Finance fit assessment:
Skills: 6/10 (assuming moderate quantitative abilities)
Motivation: 4/10 (if you find the work itself less meaningful)
Competitive advantage: 6/10 (depends on your background)
Overall fit score: 5.3/10
The expected impact should be multiplied by these fit scores, as they approximate your probability of success and longevity in each path.
Step 6: Create a concrete decision tree with optionality analysis
Rather than viewing this as a one-time decision, let's map out a decision tree that preserves optionality:
Initial exploration phase (1-2 years):
Pursue technical prerequisites for AI safety (e.g., ML coursework, research experience)
Apply to both finance roles and AI safety research positions/PhD programs
Set clear evaluation criteria and timeline for decision
Decision point based on:
Offers received (concrete opportunities)
Performance during exploration (objective feedback)
Updated personal fit assessment (after direct experience)
Reevaluation points every 2-3 years:
Impact achieved vs. expectations
New information about field trajectories
Personal sustainability and growth
Step 7: Propose a concrete next-step plan
Based on this analysis, here's what an effective altruist approach would recommend:
If your personal fit assessment favors AI safety research (>6/10) and you have the technical prerequisites:
Prioritize getting research experience through internships, research assistant positions, or PhD applications
Develop specific AI safety expertise rather than general ML skills
Maintain finance as a backup option if research fit proves lower than expected
If your personal fit assessment favors finance (>6/10) or you lack AI safety prerequisites:
Pursue finance while building specific skills relevant to AI safety
Commit to significant donations to effective charities (~50% of income)
Maintain connections to the AI safety community to stay informed about talent needs
If both scores are similar or uncertain:
Prioritize a time-limited exploration (1-2 years)
Set concrete milestones for reassessment
Consider hybrid paths (e.g., AI-focused roles in finance)
This analysis demonstrates the concrete, quantitative approach effective altruists take to career decisions, going beyond general principles to model specific impact pathways, compare expected values across different domains, and develop structured decision processes that account for uncertainty and personal fit.","{

            ""content"": ""Let me walk you through a concrete effective altruism analysis for this career decision between AI safety research and earning to give in finance. Rather than just discussing theory, I'll demonstrate the actual reasoning process an effective altruist might use.
Step 1: Establish a framework for career impact
We'll analyze these options across four key dimensions:
Direct impact (the good done directly through your work)
Earnings potential (for donations)
Career capital (skills, credentials, connections gained)
Personal fit (likelihood of success and sustainability)
Step 2: Gather concrete impact estimates for AI safety research
Let's start with a direct work path in AI safety research:
Direct impact potential:
Problem scale: Potentially extreme (existential risk reduction)
Marginal contribution: Varies widely based on talent and breakthrough potential
Simplified expected value calculation:
Assumption: AI safety researcher has a 0.01% chance of making a contribution that reduces existential risk by 0.1%
If we value the long-term future at 10^16 expected future lives
Expected impact: 0.0001 × 0.001 × 10^16 = 10^9 expected lives influenced
Earnings potential for donations:
Academic track: $80,000-$150,000 (post-PhD)
Industry research track: $150,000-$400,000+
Donation potential (50% of post-tax income):
Academic: $25,000-$60,000/year
Industry: $60,000-$150,000+/year
Career capital:
Technical skills: Very high value, transferable to many domains
Network: High value in emerging field
Credentials: PhD or research publications highly valued
Options: Preserves paths to academia, industry, and policy
Personal fit factors to assess:
Mathematical aptitude (critical)
Research temperament (critical)
Comfort with uncertainty and long feedback loops (critical)
Required credentials: Usually PhD in relevant field
Field growth trajectory: Rapidly expanding
Step 3: Gather concrete impact estimates for finance (earning to give)
Now let's analyze the finance path:
Direct impact potential:
Problem scale: Varies by type of finance (can be negative in extractive roles)
Marginal contribution: Limited direct positive impact; potential negative externalities
Expected direct impact: Potentially net negative without careful role selection
Earnings potential for donations:
Entry level: $100,000-$150,000
Mid-career (5-10 years): $300,000-$800,000+
Donation potential (50% of post-tax income):
Early career: $40,000-$60,000/year
Mid-career: $120,000-$300,000+/year
Career capital:
Technical skills: Moderate value, somewhat transferable
Network: High value, especially for future fundraising
Credentials: Valuable in business sectors
Options: Preserves paths to business, entrepreneurship, and operations roles
Personal fit factors to assess:
Quantitative skills (important)
Work ethic and stress tolerance (critical)
Cultural fit with competitive environments (important)
Required credentials: Usually finance, economics, or STEM degree
Field stability: Well-established but cyclical
Step 4: Compare quantitative impact estimates
Let's directly compare the expected impact from donations versus direct work:
For finance (earning to give):
Mid-career annual donations: ~$200,000/year (middle estimate)
Effectiveness of donations: If directed to GiveWell top charities at ~$5,000/life saved equivalent
Annual impact: ~40 lives saved equivalent per year
Career impact (30-year career): ~1,200 lives saved equivalent
For AI safety research:
Expected impact: Much harder to quantify precisely
Orders-of-magnitude estimate from above: 10^9 expected lives influenced
Even if we discount this by 99.99% due to uncertainty, the expected value still exceeds the earning to give path

,,Evaluation,Application,,"I'm putting together an effective altruism committee at my company that will have $100,000 annually to allocate to charitable causes. How should we structure the evaluation process and what criteria should we use to compare different giving opportunities?","I'll provide a concrete process for your corporate EA committee to evaluate and compare giving opportunities, focusing on practical implementation rather than just theory.
Step 1: Establish your evaluation infrastructure
Start by creating these specific tools and documents:
1. Cause consideration spreadsheet: Create a spreadsheet with these columns:
Cause area (e.g., global health, animal welfare)
Scale (quantified estimate of problem magnitude)
Neglectedness (funding gap, annual spending as % of problem size)
Tractability (expected impact per $1,000 invested)
Fit with company values (1-5 rating with specific criteria)
Evidence quality (1-5 rating with specific definitions)
Overall priority score (weighted formula combining above factors)
2. Charity evaluation template: For each organization, collect:
Theory of change (specific causal pathway from activities to outcomes)
Cost-effectiveness estimate (with explicit units, e.g., ""lives saved per $10,000"")
Evidence quality assessment (RCTs, observational studies, theory only, etc.)
Room for more funding (specific funding gaps with marginal utility curve)
Organizational strength metrics (leadership quality, financial stability, transparency)
Track record of successful implementation
Monitoring and evaluation systems
3. Comparison methodology document: Define exactly how you'll:
Convert different impacts to comparable units
Weight different criteria in final decisions
Handle uncertainty in impact estimates
Resolve disagreements among committee members
Step 2: Implement a structured evaluation process
Here's a concrete month-by-month process for your annual cycle:
Month 1: Cause area prioritization
Committee members independently score 5-10 cause areas using the spreadsheet
Meet to discuss differences in assessments, updating based on new information
Select 2-3 top cause areas for deeper investigation
Assign research leads for each priority cause area
Month 2-3: Charity investigation For each priority cause area:
Identify 3-5 promising organizations
Complete evaluation templates for each organization
Conduct at least one call with each organization to clarify questions
Produce a 2-page summary of each charity with standardized metrics
Month 4: Comparative analysis
Create side-by-side comparison of all evaluated organizations
Calculate cost-effectiveness estimates using consistent methodology
Apply sensitivity analysis to test how different assumptions affect rankings
Generate preliminary allocation recommendation
Month 5: Final decision
Committee discusses preliminary recommendations
Address key uncertainties through additional research if needed
Finalize allocation decisions with explicit rationales
Document expected outcomes for future evaluation
Step 3: Apply rigorous evaluation criteria
Here are concrete criteria with specific measurement approaches:
1. Impact metrics by cause area Establish standardized units of impact for key cause areas:
For global health and development:
Cost per life saved equivalent (using standard DALY/QALY methodologies)
Cost per person lifted from extreme poverty
Expected income increase per dollar donated
For animal welfare:
Animal lives improved per dollar donated
Days of suffering prevented per dollar donated
Standard animal-weighted QALYs
For climate change:
Cost per ton of CO₂-equivalent averted
Cost per degree of warming averted (for large-scale interventions)
For existential risk reduction:
Expected impact using probabilistic models
Reduction in extinction probability per dollar (even if tiny)
2. Evidence quality assessment rubric
Create a 5-level evidence rating:
Theoretical only - Reasonable theory of change but no implementation data
Anecdotal/observational - Some evidence of implementation success but no controlled studies
Quasi-experimental - Before/after comparisons or natural experiments
Single/few RCTs - Demonstrated causality in limited contexts
Multiple RCTs/systematic reviews - Robust evidence across contexts
3. Organizational effectiveness criteria
Evaluate each organization on:
Leadership quality (track record, strategic clarity, adaptability)
Financial health (reserves, efficiency ratios, sustainable funding model)
Operational capacity (ability to absorb and effectively use funds)
Learning systems (how organization responds to new information)
Transparency (quality and comprehensiveness of public information)
Step 4: Create a concrete allocation framework
Develop a systematic approach to actual allocation decisions:
1. Portfolio construction model
Allocate your $100,000 across these categories:
Evidence-backed interventions (60-70%): Allocate to organizations with strongest evidence and highest expected impact
Exploratory giving (20-30%): Support promising interventions with limited evidence but high potential
Movement building (10-15%): Fund meta-initiatives that grow effective giving more broadly
Opportunity fund (5-10%): Reserve for unexpected high-value opportunities during the year
2. Diminishing returns adjustment
For each potential recipient, model:
Current funding level
Room for more funding
Shape of the marginal impact curve
Funding from other sources
Use this to estimate the marginal impact of your specific contribution rather than average impact.
3. Uncertainty adjustment
For impact estimates with different uncertainty levels:
Calculate the expected value for each opportunity
Apply a consistent discount rate to more uncertain estimates
Consider the information value of funding less-certain interventions
Step 5: Implement impact tracking systems
Establish concrete follow-up mechanisms:
1. Explicit expected outcomes For each grant, document:
Specific outputs expected (e.g., ""1,000 bednets distributed"")
Outcomes predicted (e.g., ""50-70 malaria cases prevented"")
Timeline for results
Key uncertainties to resolve
2. Annual impact review Schedule a dedicated session to:
Compare actual vs. expected outcomes
Update impact estimates based on new evidence
Refine evaluation methodology
Document lessons learned for next cycle
This structured approach ensures your corporate EA committee will implement a rigorous, transparent process that balances analytical rigor with practical implementation. It transforms effective altruism principles from abstract concepts into a concrete system for maximizing the impact of your company's charitable budget.","{

,,Evidence Based Evaluation,Application,,I want to apply effective altruism principles to decide whether to donate to a local homeless shelter or a global health charity. Can you walk me through how to quantitatively compare these options?,"I'll walk you through a step-by-step quantitative comparison between donating to a local homeless shelter versus a global health charity, demonstrating how to apply effective altruism principles in practice.
Step 1: Gather concrete data on both interventions
Let's start by collecting specific impact data for both options, assuming a $1,000 donation.
For the local homeless shelter:
Operating cost: Typically $25-50 per night per person housed
Services provided: Shelter, meals, sometimes case management
Let's say your specific shelter costs $30 per person per night
Your $1,000 donation provides: 33 person-nights of shelter ($1,000 ÷ $30)
Additional benefits: Perhaps 66 meals (2 per day) and basic services
For the global health charity:
Let's use Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) as an example
Cost per bednet: ~$5.00 (distributed)
Protection: Each net protects ~1.8 people for ~2 years
Malaria prevention: ~0.0045-0.0065 deaths averted per net
Your $1,000 donation provides: 200 nets ($1,000 ÷ $5)
Impact: ~360 person-years of protection (200 nets × 1.8 people × 2 years)
Lives saved: ~0.9-1.3 (200 nets × 0.0045-0.0065 deaths averted per net)
Step 2: Convert to comparable units
To compare these different interventions, we need a common metric. Let's use quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or a similar welfare metric.
For the homeless shelter:
Baseline assumption: Homelessness reduces quality of life significantly
Without shelter: Assume quality of life rating of 0.4 (on 0-1 scale)
With shelter: Assume quality of life rating of 0.6 for that day
QALY gain per person-night: 0.2 × (1/365) ≈ 0.00055 QALYs
Total QALY impact: 33 person-nights × 0.00055 ≈ 0.018 QALYs
For the global health charity (AMF):
Life saved: ~40 QALYs per life (assuming ~40 years life expectancy in relevant countries)
Non-fatal malaria cases prevented: ~200 nets × 0.5 cases prevented per net ≈ 100 cases
QALY gain per non-fatal case prevented: ~0.05 QALYs
QALY from non-fatal prevention: 100 cases × 0.05 ≈ 5 QALYs
Total QALY impact: (0.9-1.3 lives × 40 QALYs) + 5 QALYs ≈ 41-57 QALYs
Step 3: Factor in counterfactual considerations
We need to consider what would happen without your specific donation.
For the homeless shelter:
Occupancy rate: Investigate if the shelter is consistently at capacity
If consistently full: Your donation may not increase total person-nights
If not at capacity: Your marginal impact may be close to the calculated 33 nights
Funding situation: Is the shelter well-funded or struggling?
Let's assume 70% counterfactual impact: 0.018 × 0.7 ≈ 0.013 QALYs
For the global health charity:
Room for more funding: AMF can typically use additional funds for nets
Funding displacement: Limited because AMF expands to new areas
Counterfactual coverage: These areas likely wouldn't receive nets otherwise
Let's assume 90% counterfactual impact: 41-57 × 0.9 ≈ 37-51 QALYs
Step 4: Consider additional factors with explicit weights
Now let's incorporate other considerations, assigning explicit weights to make our reasoning transparent:
Local benefits (weight: 15%)
Homeless shelter: Direct benefit to your community (score: 9/10)
Global health: Minimal local benefit (score: 1/10)
Weighted scores: Shelter = 1.35, Global health = 0.15
Personal connection (weight: 10%)
Homeless shelter: Potential for direct involvement (score: 8/10)
Global health: Limited personal connection (score: 3/10)
Weighted scores: Shelter = 0.8, Global health = 0.3
Evidence quality (weight: 25%)
Homeless shelter: Limited outcome tracking, primarily process metrics (score: 4/10)
Global health: Multiple RCTs, strong monitoring (score: 9/10)
Weighted scores: Shelter = 1.0, Global health = 2.25
Cost-effectiveness (weight: 50%)
Homeless shelter: 0.013 QALYs per $1,000 (score: 2/10)
Global health: 37-51 QALYs per $1,000 (score: 9/10)
Weighted scores: Shelter = 1.0, Global health = 4.5
Total weighted scores:
Homeless shelter: 4.15/10
Global health charity: 7.2/10
Step 5: Sensitivity analysis
Let's test how robust this conclusion is to different assumptions.
If we change the QALY impact of shelter:
Even if we increase the impact 10× (0.13 QALYs), global health remains more effective
The difference would need to be 100× smaller for them to be comparable
If we adjust the weights:
Even weighting local benefits at 40% would still favor global health
Global health dominates unless local benefits and personal connection together exceed 70% of decision weight
Uncertainty ranges:
Global health: Even at lower bound (37 QALYs), still >2,800× more QALYs per dollar
This difference is large enough to remain robust across most reasonable assumptions
Step 6: Consider a portfolio approach
Given this analysis, consider these concrete options:
Option 1: Maximize expected impact (standard EA approach)
Allocate 100% to the global health charity
Expected impact: 37-51 QALYs
Option 2: Value diversification
Allocate 80% to global health, 20% to local shelter
Expected impact: ~30-41 QALYs + 0.003 QALYs + local benefits
Allows maintaining connection with local issues
Option 3: Address different values separately
Budget separately for effectiveness-focused giving vs. community-focused giving
For example: Commit 10% of income to global health, plus separate volunteering and smaller donations locally
Conclusion and recommendation
The quantitative analysis strongly favors the global health charity by orders of magnitude in terms of welfare impact per dollar. However, the decision should reflect your values and priorities.
If maximizing welfare is your primary goal, directing your donation to the global health charity is clearly supported by this analysis. The difference in impact is so large that it remains robust across most reasonable assumptions and parameter values.
That said, a mixed approach acknowledges other legitimate values like community connection. Consider allocating a larger percentage to the more effective intervention while maintaining some support for local issues, either through a smaller donation or through volunteering your time rather than money.","{

QALY from non-fatal prevention: 100 cases × 0.05 ≈ 5 QALYs
Total QALY impact: (0.9-1.3 lives × 40 QALYs) + 5 QALYs ≈ 41-57 QALYs
Step 3: Factor in counterfactual considerations
We need to consider what would happen without your specific donation.
For the homeless shelter:
Occupancy rate: Investigate if the shelter is consistently at capacity
If consistently full: Your donation may not increase total person-nights
If not at capacity: Your marginal impact may be close to the calculated 33 nights
Funding situation: Is the shelter well-funded or struggling?
Let's assume 70% counterfactual impact: 0.018 × 0.7 ≈ 0.013 QALYs
For the global health charity:
Room for more funding: AMF can typically use additional funds for nets
Funding displacement: Limited because AMF expands to new areas
Counterfactual coverage: These areas likely wouldn't receive nets otherwise
Let's assume 90% counterfactual impact: 41-57 × 0.9 ≈ 37-51 QALYs
Step 4: Consider additional factors with explicit weights
Now let's incorporate other considerations, assigning explicit weights to make our reasoning transparent:
Local benefits (weight: 15%)
Homeless shelter: Direct benefit to your community (score: 9/10)
Global health: Minimal local benefit (score: 1/10)
Weighted scores: Shelter = 1.35, Global health = 0.15
Personal connection (weight: 10%)
Homeless shelter: Potential for direct involvement (score: 8/10)
Global health: Limited personal connection (score: 3/10)
Weighted scores: Shelter = 0.8, Global health = 0.3
Evidence quality (weight: 25%)
Homeless shelter: Limited outcome tracking, primarily process metrics (score: 4/10)
Global health: Multiple RCTs, strong monitoring (score: 9/10)
Weighted scores: Shelter = 1.0, Global health = 2.25
Cost-effectiveness (weight: 50%)
Homeless shelter: 0.013 QALYs per $1,000 (score: 2/10)
Global health: 37-51 QALYs per $1,000 (score: 9/10)
Weighted scores: Shelter = 1.0, Global health = 4.5
Total weighted scores:
Homeless shelter: 4.15/10
Global health charity: 7.2/10
Step 5: Sensitivity analysis
Let's test how robust this conclusion is to different assumptions.
If we change the QALY impact of shelter:
Even if we increase the impact 10× (0.13 QALYs), global health remains more effective
The difference would need to be 100× smaller for them to be comparable
If we adjust the weights:
Even weighting local benefits at 40% would still favor global health
Global health dominates unless local benefits and personal connection together exceed 70% of decision weight
Uncertainty ranges:
Global health: Even at lower bound (37 QALYs), still >2,800× more QALYs per dollar
This difference is large enough to remain robust across most reasonable assumptions
Step 6: Consider a portfolio approach
Given this analysis, consider these concrete options:
Option 1: Maximize expected impact (standard EA approach)
Allocate 100% to the global health charity
Expected impact: 37-51 QALYs
Option 2: Value diversification
Allocate 80% to global health, 20% to local shelter
Expected impact: ~30-41 QALYs + 0.003 QALYs + local benefits
Allows maintaining connection with local issues
Option 3: Address different values separately
Budget separately for effectiveness-focused giving vs. community-focused giving
For example: Commit 10% of income to global health, plus separate volunteering and smaller donations locally
Conclusion and recommendation
The quantitative analysis strongly favors the global health charity by orders of magnitude in terms of welfare impact per dollar. However, the decision should reflect your values and priorities.
If maximizing welfare is your primary goal, directing your donation to the global health charity is clearly supported by this analysis. The difference in impact is so large that it remains robust across most reasonable assumptions and parameter values.
That said, a mixed approach acknowledges other legitimate values like community connection. Consider allocating a larger percentage to the more effective intervention while maintaining some support for local issues, either through a smaller donation or through volunteering your time rather than money.""

,,ITN,Application,I've heard about the 'ITN framework' for cause prioritization in effective altruism. Can you demonstrate how to actually apply this framework to evaluate and compare potential cause areas?,,"Let me demonstrate how to apply the ITN (Importance, Tractability, Neglectedness) framework in practice by walking through a concrete comparison of three cause areas: global health, factory farming, and biosecurity. Rather than just explaining the framework, I'll show the actual analysis process an effective altruist would use.
Step 1: Set up a systematic evaluation structure
First, let's establish how we'll evaluate each component with specific metrics:
Importance (Scale)
Quantified as: ""How much good could be accomplished if the problem were completely solved?""
Units: Typically DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years), QALYs, or similar welfare metrics
Scale: Orders of magnitude (10^x) to compare vastly different problems
Tractability
Quantified as: ""What fraction of the problem would be solved by doubling current resources?""
Units: Percentage improvement per doubling of resources
Scale: 0-10% (very difficult) to 50%+ (highly tractable)
Neglectedness
Quantified as: ""How many resources are currently directed at this problem?""
Units: Annual dollars spent and/or full-time equivalent people working on it
Scale: Orders of magnitude (10^x)
Step 2: Gather data and estimates for each cause area
Let's collect specific data for our three example cause areas:
Global Health (focusing on malaria)
Importance:
~400,000 deaths annually
~200 million cases causing ~83 million DALYs per year
If completely solved: ~2.5 billion DALYs saved over the next 30 years
Tractability:
Several proven interventions (bednets, indoor spraying, etc.)
Doubling resources estimated to reduce burden by ~15-30%
Neglectedness:
Current annual spending: ~$3.1 billion
~10,000 full-time professionals
Factory Farming (animal welfare)
Importance:
~70 billion land animals in factory farms annually
Assuming average farm animal experiences suffering equivalent to ~0.3 human-equivalent suffering years
Total scale: ~21 billion suffering-adjusted life years annually
Tractability:
Corporate campaigns have succeeded in changing practices
Doubling resources estimated to reduce suffering by ~5-15%
Neglectedness:
Current annual spending: ~$50-80 million globally
~1,000-2,000 full-time professionals
Biosecurity (pandemic prevention)
Importance:
Catastrophic biological risk could cause millions to billions of deaths
Expected value: ~30 million DALYs lost annually to potential pandemics
Existential risk component adds significant expected value
Tractability:
Some interventions proven effective for known pathogens
Doubling resources estimated to reduce risk by ~2-10%
Neglectedness:
Current annual spending: ~$1-2 billion (pre-COVID)
~5,000-10,000 full-time professionals
Step 3: Calculate ITN scores with explicit methodology
Now let's calculate a score for each cause area using a multiplicative model:
ITN Score = Importance × Tractability × (1/Neglectedness)
To make this computation manageable, we'll use logarithmic scales for importance and neglectedness:
For Global Health (malaria):
Log₁₀(Importance): log₁₀(2.5 × 10^9 DALYs) ≈ 9.4
Tractability: 0.225 (midpoint of 15-30%)
Log₁₀(1/Neglectedness): log₁₀(1/3.1 × 10^9) ≈ -9.5
ITN Score: 9.4 × 0.225 × (-9.5) ≈ -20.1
For Factory Farming:
Log₁₀(Importance): log₁₀(21 × 10^9 suffering years) ≈ 10.3
Tractability: 0.1 (midpoint of 5-15%)
Log₁₀(1/Neglectedness): log₁₀(1/65 × 10^6) ≈ -7.8
ITN Score: 10.3 × 0.1 × (-7.8) ≈ -8.0
For Biosecurity:
Log₁₀(Importance): log₁₀(30 × 10^6 DALYs + existential risk component) ≈ 9.5 (conservative)
Tractability: 0.06 (midpoint of 2-10%)
Log₁₀(1/Neglectedness): log₁₀(1/1.5 × 10^9) ≈ -9.2
ITN Score: 9.5 × 0.06 × (-9.2) ≈ -5.2
Step 4: Translate scores to concrete funding recommendations
The negative scores reflect our use of the inverse of neglectedness. More negative scores indicate less promising opportunities. Based on these calculations, the order of priority would be:
Biosecurity (ITN Score: -5.2)
Factory Farming (ITN Score: -8.0)
Global Health (ITN Score: -20.1)
To convert these into practical allocation recommendations:
Proportional allocation method: Convert scores to positive values and normalize:
Biosecurity: 5.2 / (5.2 + 8.0 + 20.1) ≈ 0.16 or 16%
Factory Farming: 8.0 / (5.2 + 8.0 + 20.1) ≈ 0.24 or 24%
Global Health: 20.1 / (5.2 + 8.0 + 20.1) ≈ 0.60 or 60%
Wait - this gives the opposite result of our ranking because we used the inverse of neglectedness. Let's recalculate correctly:
Corrected approach:
Biosecurity: 9.5 × 0.06 / (1.5 × 10^9) ≈ 3.8 × 10^-10
Factory Farming: 10.3 × 0.1 / (65 × 10^6) ≈

Let's recalculate the ITN scores using a more direct approach that avoids the logarithmic conversion issue:
Direct ITN Calculation Approach:
We'll calculate: ITN Score = (Importance × Tractability) / Resources currently allocated
For Global Health (malaria):
Importance: 2.5 × 10^9 DALYs (over 30 years)
Tractability: 0.225 (midpoint of 15-30% problem solved per doubling)
Resources: $3.1 billion annually
ITN Score: (2.5 × 10^9 × 0.225) / (3.1 × 10^9) ≈ 0.18
For Factory Farming:
Importance: 21 × 10^9 suffering-adjusted years annually
Tractability: 0.1 (midpoint of 5-15%)
Resources: $65 million annually (midpoint of $50-80 million)
ITN Score: (21 × 10^9 × 0.1) / (65 × 10^6) ≈ 32,308
For Biosecurity:
Importance: Let's conservatively use 30 × 10^6 DALYs annually (not counting existential risk)
Tractability: 0.06 (midpoint of 2-10%)
Resources: $1.5 billion annually (midpoint of $1-2 billion)
ITN Score: (30 × 10^6 × 0.06) / (1.5 × 10^9) ≈ 0.0012
With this direct calculation, the prioritization becomes:
Factory Farming (ITN Score: 32,308)
Global Health (ITN Score: 0.18)
Biosecurity (ITN Score: 0.0012)
However, this calculation is highly sensitive to how we quantify importance. If we included existential risk in biosecurity (e.g., 0.01% annual probability of an event causing 8 billion deaths), the biosecurity score would increase dramatically.
Step 5: Conduct sensitivity analysis
Let's examine how sensitive these results are to our assumptions:
For Factory Farming:
If we used more conservative moral weights (e.g., valuing animal suffering at 1% of human suffering), the score would be ~323, still ranking highest
If we assumed current resources are 10× higher, the score would be ~3,231, still ranking highest
For Global Health:
If we assumed tractability is at the upper end (30%), the score would be ~0.24
If we included positive economic effects of eliminating malaria, importance might increase 3×, yielding a score of ~0.54
For Biosecurity:
If we included existential risk (say 0.01% annual probability of 8 billion deaths), importance increases to ~800 million DALYs annually, yielding a score of ~0.032
If we considered that COVID increased biosecurity funding 5×, the score would decrease to ~0.0002
This sensitivity analysis suggests that factory farming's priority is robust to reasonable assumption changes, while the ranking between global health and biosecurity depends heavily on how we value existential risk.
Step 6: Refine with additional considerations
The basic ITN framework can be enhanced with these additional factors:
Robustness of evidence:
Global Health: Strong (multiple RCTs) → high confidence in estimates
Factory Farming: Moderate (successful campaigns, but fewer controlled studies) → medium confidence
Biosecurity: Variable (strong for some interventions, speculative for others) → wider uncertainty ranges
Personal fit factors:
Comparative advantage: Assess your skills/background relative to needs in each area
Expertise: Where could you develop specialized knowledge most quickly?
Network: Where do you have connections that could amplify your impact?
Implementation paths: For each cause area, specify concrete next actions:
For Factory Farming:
Donate to organizations like The Humane League or Good Food Institute
Support corporate campaigns for welfare improvements
Fund alternative protein research
For Global Health:
Donate to GiveWell's top charities focused on malaria
Support policy advocacy for increased government funding
Invest in implementation research to increase intervention effectiveness
For Biosecurity:
Support research on pathogen surveillance systems
Fund policy work on international coordination mechanisms
Donate to organizations developing pandemic prevention technologies
Step 7: Create a concrete allocation plan
Based on this analysis, a reasonable allocation of resources might be:
Factory Farming: 60%
Largest share due to highest ITN score and robustness to assumption changes
Focus on corporate campaigns with proven track records
Global Health: 25%
Smaller share despite established interventions due to higher current funding
Focus on the most cost-effective, evidence-backed interventions
Biosecurity: 15%
Smallest allocation given uncertainty, but included due to tail risk considerations
Focus on areas with demonstrated effectiveness rather than speculative approaches
This allocation balances the quantitative ITN analysis with evidence quality considerations and diversification across different risk profiles.
Step 8: Establish review triggers
Finally, define specific conditions that would prompt revisiting this analysis:
New evidence: Major studies that significantly change tractability estimates
Funding changes: Large influxes of resources to any area (changing neglectedness)
Scale updates: New information about the magnitude of any problem
Calendar-based: Annual review of assumptions and calculations
This demonstration shows how the ITN framework moves from abstract theory to concrete cause prioritization decisions. The framework doesn't eliminate the need for judgment calls, but it makes the reasoning process explicit and allows for structured debate about key assumptions.",
