Propose methods for evaluating less quantified outcomes",,,
Global Health & Development,Critique/Limitation,"An organizer in charge of supporting an overseas developing community must decide whether or not to support a local, culturally-sensitive initiative.

These compounding effects can be directly related or support different interventions over time",,,

How should the donor make the decision on which to support?,"Weigh certainty of near term benefits and long term impact for both causes
Address EA’s critique of bias on speculative, long-term outcomes",,,
