In Phase 3, we move from basic agent interactions to implementing formal governance structures. This is where your multi-agent system transforms from a simple discussion forum into an organized decision-making body with defined roles, procedures, and checks and balances.

## Objectives

- Design and implement multiple governance structure models
- Create formal decision-making protocols for each structure
- Establish roles, responsibilities, and authorities within each system
- Develop metrics to compare governance structure effectiveness
- Test governance resilience under various scenarios
- Document emergent behaviors and dynamics within structured systems

## Implementation Notes

Phase 3 represents a significant step up in complexity from the previous phases. You're now creating structured systems with formal rules rather than just observing agent interactions. To make this manageable, I recommend implementing one governance model at a time, starting with the simplest (perhaps the sequential refinement model) and building up to more complex structures.

Think of this phase as designing different types of meetings or decision-making bodies. Just as a company might use different formats for different decisions (executive team meetings for strategy, project reviews for implementation details, town halls for company-wide issues), your governance system will develop specialized structures for different types of problems.

A helpful analogy is designing a government from scratch. You're creating the equivalent of legislative processes, judicial reviews, and executive actions, each with their own rules and responsibilities. By implementing multiple approaches, you'll discover which structures work best for which types of decisions.

## Example: Consensus Protocol Design

Here's a simplified example of what a consensus protocol might look like:

1. **Proposal Stage**:
    
    - One agent (proposer) formulates an initial proposal
    - Proposal includes recommended action and rationale
    - System distributes proposal to all council members
2. **Clarification Stage**:
    
    - Council members ask questions about the proposal
    - Proposer provides clarifications
    - No evaluative statements allowed at this stage
3. **Critique Stage**:
    
    - Each council member offers structured critique
    - Format: "I [agree/disagree] because [reasoning]..."
    - Critiques must address specific aspects of proposal
4. **Refinement Stage**:
    
    - Proposer offers refined proposal based on critiques
    - Council members indicate satisfaction with refinements
    - Process iterates until refinements slow or stop
5. **Consensus Check**:
    
    - Formal query to all council members
    - Options: "Consent" (can live with it), "Stand aside" (concerns but won't block), "Block" (cannot accept)
    - Consensus achieved when all members Consent or Stand aside

This protocol balances thoroughness with efficiency by providing structured stages while allowing for iterative improvement.
