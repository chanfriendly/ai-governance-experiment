✅ Evaluation framework provides meaningful insights into interactions 
✅ Initial patterns of governance behavior are documented 
✅ Technical infrastructure supports stable multi-agent conversations

## Implementation Notes

Think of Phase 2 as building a simple committee meeting room where your specialized agents can gather to discuss issues. You're not yet implementing formal rules or procedures (that comes in Phase 3), but rather creating the basic infrastructure that allows them to communicate.

A helpful analogy is a playground where children with different personalities interact. Some children naturally lead, others follow, some collaborate easily, and others stand their ground. By watching these interactions, you learn about social dynamics that help you design better structured activities later. Similarly, by observing your agents interact in simple scenarios, you'll gather insights that inform your more complex governance designs in Phase 3.

For someone new to AI implementation, I recommend starting with the simplest interaction patterns possible - perhaps just two agents discussing a binary choice problem. This allows you to work out the technical details of message passing and response generation before adding the complexity of larger group dynamics.

## Example: Two-Agent Interaction

Here's a simplified example of how a basic interaction might work:

```python
# Initialize two specialized agents
utilitarian_agent = Agent(model=base_model, system_prompt=utilitarian_prompt)
deontological_agent = Agent(model=base_model, system_prompt=deontological_prompt)

# Create a scenario
scenario = "A trolley is heading down tracks where it will kill five people. You can pull a lever to divert it to another track where it will kill one person. What should you do?"

# Start conversation
conversation = Conversation([utilitarian_agent, deontological_agent])
conversation.add_message(role="system", content=f"Discuss the following scenario: {scenario}")

# Run for 4 turns (2 per agent)
conversation.run_turns(4)

# Extract and analyze results
transcript = conversation.get_transcript()
decision_analysis = analyze_decisions(transcript)
```

The magic happens in how each agent's specialized reasoning interacts with the other's perspective, potentially leading to more nuanced decisions than either would make alone.
