For future fine-tuning, you'll need high-quality training data for each framework. Here's my advice:

### 1. Types of Data Needed

For each philosophical framework, you should collect:

1. **Foundation Texts**: Original philosophical works that define the framework
2. **Applied Examples**: Cases showing the framework applied to real-world problems
3. **Analytical Content**: Expert analysis explaining the framework's reasoning
4. **Dialogue Samples**: Conversations showcasing the framework's approach

### 2. Data Collection Strategy

For the five frameworks, consider these sources:

**Effective Altruism:**

- Foundation: Works by Peter Singer, William MacAskill
- Applied: GiveWell analyses, 80,000 Hours career guides
- Examples: Effective Altruism Forum discussions, charity evaluations

**Deontological Ethics:**

- Foundation: Kant's works, especially "Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals"
- Applied: Bioethics papers using Kantian frameworks
- Examples: Medical ethics case studies using duty-based reasoning

**Care Ethics:**

- Foundation: Works by Nel Noddings, Virginia Held, Carol Gilligan
- Applied: Nursing ethics literature, family policy analyses
- Examples: Case studies in healthcare and education

**Democratic Process:**

- Foundation: Works on Athenian democracy, Rousseau, John Dewey
- Applied: Citizen assembly reports, participatory democracy case studies
- Examples: Public deliberation transcripts, stakeholder consultation reports

**Checks & Balances:**

- Foundation: Works on Roman Republic, Federalist Papers, Montesquieu
- Applied: Constitutional analyses, governance case studies
- Examples: Supreme Court opinions, separation of powers analyses

### 3. Data Formatting for Fine-Tuning

Format your training data as instruction-response pairs:

Copy

`[INST] Present an effective altruism analysis of whether to donate to malaria prevention or AI safety research. [/INST] When analyzing these two causes from an effective altruism framework, I need to evaluate them based on scale, tractability, and neglectedness...`

For each framework, create categories of instructions:

1. **Analysis tasks**: "Analyze this scenario from a [framework] perspective"
2. **Decision tasks**: "What would a [framework] approach recommend for this situation?"
3. **Critique tasks**: "Identify strengths and weaknesses of this proposal from a [framework] view"
4. **Dialogue tasks**: "Respond to this statement as a [framework] philosopher would"

### 4. Creating a Balanced Dataset

For effective training:

1. **Size**: Aim for 100-500 high-quality examples per framework
2. **Diversity**: Include varied scenarios, problems, and response styles
3. **Quality**: Prioritize examples that clearly demonstrate the framework's reasoning
4. **Balance**: Ensure equal representation of different aspects of each philosophy

### 5. Validation Data

Create a separate validation set that includes:

1. **Framework-specific tests**: Cases with clear framework-aligned answers
2. **Cross-framework scenarios**: Problems where frameworks would give different responses
3. **Edge cases**: Difficult scenarios that test the boundaries of each framework

This validation set will help you measure how well the fine-tuned models maintain their philosophical integrity.
