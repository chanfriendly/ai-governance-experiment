You’d be pretty pleased,<br><br>right? What the conclusions from the economic studies<br><br>suggest is that the benefit you would get from having your<br><br>salary doubled is the same as the benefit an extremely poor<br><br>Indian farmer earning $220 a year would get from an additional $220.<br><br>  <br><br>As noted earlier, the typical US wage is $28,000<br><br>(£18,200), so there is good theoretical reason for thinking<br><br>that the same amount of money can be of at least one<br><br>hundred times as much benefit to the very poorest people<br><br>in the world as it can be to typical citizens of the West.<br><br>Anyone earning this much is one hundred times as rich<br><br>as the very poorest people in the world, which means<br><br>one additional unit of income can do a hundred times<br><br>as much to benefit the extreme poor as it can to benefit<br><br>you or I. This isn’t to say that income is all.that matters to<br><br>wellbeing — of course other factors such as safety and political freedom are involved. But income certainly plays a<br><br>critical role in how enjoyable, long, and healthy your life is.<br><br>Looking at how much we can benefit people via increasing<br><br>their income gives us a particularly robust way of assessing<br><br>how much we can benefit others compared to ourselves.<br><br>It’s not often you have two options, one of which is a<br><br>hundred times better than the other. Imagine a happy hour<br><br>where you could either buy yourself a beer for $5 or buy<br><br>someone else a beer for s¢. If that were the case, we'd probably be pretty generous — next round’s on me! But that’s<br><br>effectively the situation we're in all the time. It’s like a 99%<br><br>off sale, or buy one, get ninety-nine free. It might be the<br><br>most amazing deal you'll see in your life.<br><br>  <br><br>This idea is important enough that I've given it a name.<br><br>I call it The 100x Multiplier. For those of us living in rich<br><br>countries, you should expect to be able to do at least one<br><br>hundred times as much to benefit other people as you can<br><br>to benefit yourself.<br><br>

| [**EffectiveAltruism.Org**](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework)                      | Framework        | Foundation Principle | The importance, tractability and neglectedness framework, or ITN framework for short, is a framework for estimating the value of allocating marginal resources to solving a problem based on its importance, tractability, and neglectedness.<br><br>  <br><br>The three factors are formally defined as follows:<br><br>- importance  = good done / % of a problem solved<br>- tractability = % of a problem solved / % increase in resources<br>- neglectedness = % increase in resources / extra person or dollar<br><br>When these terms are multiplied, some of the units cancel out, resulting in a quantity denominated in good done per extra person or dollar.<br><br>Other differences between Karnofsky's model and Cotton-Barratt's are the terminology ("importance, tractability and uncrowdedness" is replaced by "scale, solvability and neglectedness") and the use of _problems_ rather than _causes_ as the main unit of analysis.

First, you can ‘save<br><br>someone's life’. The second way to benefit someone is to improve the quality of their life during the time they are alive. Migraines don’t kill people but, as someone who occasionally suffers from them, I know that life is better without them.<br><br>  <br><br>The QALY combines these two benefits into one metric, using survey data about the trade-offs people are willing to make in order to assess how bad different sorts of illnesses or disabilities are. <br><br>Pgs 39-40

It could be that aid is entirely<br><br>incidental, or even harmful, holding back still greater progress that would have happened anyway or otherwise. But in fact there’s good reason to think that, on average, international aid spending has been incredibly beneficial. Moyo points to aid’s inefficiencies by focusing on typical aid programs. But to get a true picture of how much benefit the developing world has received from aid, one needs to focus instead on the best aid programs.<br><br>Pg. 53-54<br><br>  <br><br>When evaluating whether aid has worked on average, it's not<br><br>enough to look at typical cases of aid; you also need to look<br><br>at the best cases. In the context of doing good, this is vital<br><br>because the best activities are often far superior to typical<br><br>ones, which can make the average benefits of aid spending<br><br>very high, even if typical benefits are small.<br><br>Pg. 56<br><br>  <br><br>In the context of helping others, the difference between a good use of money and a great use of money is huge. We shouldn't just ask: ‘Is this program a good use of money?’ We need to ask: ‘Is this program the best use of money?’<br><br>Pg. 60

Suppose you receive<br><br>a new sweater for Christmas. How good is that sweater? The<br><br>answer depends on how many sweaters you already have. If<br><br>it’s winter, you're homeless, and you have no warm clothes,<br><br>that sweater might prevent you from getting hypothermia<br><br>so an additional sweater would be extremely valuable. If you’ve got a place to live but are low on sweaters, that extra cable-knit might give you something new to wear on a cold day and would therefore still be pretty valuable. If you already have too many sweaters, though, one more might just be a nuisance — one extra thing to pack when you move — and therefore be bad overall. The value of a new sweater decreases the more sweaters you already have. The value can even become negative if you already have lots of sweaters. <br><br>Pg. 67-68<br><br>  <br><br>The law of diminishing returns provides a useful rule of thumb for comparing causes. If a specific area has already received a great deal of funding and attention, then we should expect it to be difficult for us to do a lot of good by devoting additional resources to that area. In contrast, within causes that are comparatively neglected, the most effective opportun ities for doing good have probably not been taken.<br><br>Pg. 69<br><br>  <br><br>The law of diminishing returns also explains why, in general, it makes less sense to donate to disaster relief than it does to donate to the best charities that fight poverty…. Ironically, the law of diminishing returns suggests that, if you feel a strong emotional reaction to a story and want to help, you should probably resist this inclination because there are probably many others like you who are also donating…. Diminishing returns also provides a powerful argument for focusing your altruistic efforts on people in poor countries rather than those in rich countries.<br><br>Pg. 71-72                     | Use “Thinking at the margin,” “marginal utility” - the water and diamonds paradox.

What matters is not who does good, but whether good is done; and the measure of how much good you achieve is the difference between what happens as a result of your actions and what would have happened anyway…. The good I do is not a matter<br><br>of the direct benefits I cause. Rather, it is the difference \| make. Even though I technically saved this woman’s life, \| actually did harm overall. Looking at what would have happened otherwise is a fundamental piece of scientific reasoning, referred to as ‘assessing the counterfactual’. But the mistake of neglecting the counterfactual is rife within the world of altruism, and this mistake can have terrible consequences.<br><br>Pg. 83-84<br><br>  <br><br>The average salary of a doctor in the UK is about £70,000 per year before tax. In dollars, that’s about $110,000 or $4.6 million over a forty-two-year career. By pursuing a particularly lucrative speciality — medical oncology — Greg could earn almost double that one day: about $200,000 per year. Earlier I said that one of the most cost-effective ways to save lives is by distributing antimalarial bed nets, which saves one life for every $3,400 spent. By pursuing medical oncology, Greg could therefore eventually donate 50% of a $200,000 annual salary while still drawing a very comfortable $100,000 per year pre-tax (donations are tax-deductible). His donations would save dozens of lives each year, considerably more than would have been the case if he'd worked directly in a poor country.<br><br>Pg. 92-93<br><br>  <br><br>In 2007 Louis Theroux, a British documentary filmmaker, released a documentary called Under the Knife in which he explored the world of cosmetic surgery in Beverly Hills. In the culmination of the show, he accused the cosmetic surgeon he'd been interviewing of wasting his talent and skills to make wannabe movie stars more attractive, rather than saving lives. What we've seen so far shows that Louis Theroux’s sentiment, while understandable, is misplaced. It’s the cosmetic surgeon’s decision about how to spend his money that really matters.<br><br>Pg. 94 | [INSTRUCTION] When evaluating different ways to do good, why is it important to consider "what would have happened otherwise" (the counterfactual)?

To calculate the expected monetary value of each bet, you look at all the possible outcomes of that bet. For each outcome, you take the monetary gain or loss and multiply it by the probability of the outcome. In this case, there are two possible outcomes, Heads and Tails. Each has a 50% chance of occurring. The expected monetary value of taking the bet is therefore (50% x +$2) + (50% x -$1) = $0.50. The expected monetary value of refusing the bet is $0. Taking the bet has the higher expected value, so you should take the bet.<br><br>Pg. 98<br><br>  <br><br>Thinking explicitly about expected value is important because humans are often terrible at assessing low-probability high-value events. Psychologists have found that people either give too much weight to low-probability events (as, perhaps, when people choose to play the lottery), or they simply ignore them altogether.<br><br>Pg. 102                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [INSTRUCTION] How should we evaluate opportunities to do good when outcomes are uncertain?
