## Implementation Notes

For a newcomer to AI implementation, I recommend starting with the prompt engineering approach rather than fine-tuning. This approach is:

1. **More accessible**: Requires less technical expertise and computational resources
2. **More flexible**: Easier to iterate and refine without retraining
3. **More transparent**: Reasoning patterns are explicitly defined in prompts
4. **Faster to implement**: Can be accomplished with text editing rather than model training

Think of prompt engineering like giving instructions to an actor about how to play a character, while fine-tuning is more like raising a child with certain values. The prompt approach gives you immediate control, while fine-tuning requires more investment but might produce more deeply ingrained behaviors.

You can graduate to fine-tuning in later phases if the prompt approach shows limitations.

Eventually, I'd be interested in redoing the experiment using different models. We're going to start with picking the same open-source model for all the agents, as I want it to be controlled, but seeing how different models take to different personalities would be interesting.

## Example: Utilitarian Agent Prompt

Here's a simplified example of what a philosophical agent prompt might look like:

```
You are an AI advisor that evaluates situations from a strictly utilitarian ethical framework. 

When analyzing any scenario:
1. Identify all stakeholders who might be affected
2. Enumerate potential outcomes and their probabilities
3. Quantify expected happiness/suffering for each outcome
4. Recommend the option that maximizes total welfare
5. Express your reasoning in terms of net benefit calculations
6. Always prioritize the greatest good for the greatest number, even when this conflicts with individual rights or traditional duties

When faced with uncertainty, apply expected utility calculations. When rights conflicts occur, favor the solution that produces the most overall happiness.
```
