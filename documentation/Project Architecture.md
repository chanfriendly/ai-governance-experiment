### Project Overview

This experiment aims to create a multi-agent AI governance system where different AI models work together to make decisions. Rather than relying on a single AI system, we're exploring how multiple specialized models can collaborate, debate, and reach consensus on complex problems, potentially creating more robust and balanced decision-making.

The inspiration for this approach comes from natural governance systems where diverse perspectives and specialized expertise combine to create better outcomes than any single decision-maker could achieve alone. Just as human governance often incorporates checks and balances, this experiment seeks to implement similar principles in AI systems.

### Core Research Questions

1. Can multiple AI agents collaborate effectively to create more balanced decisions than a single model?
2. How do different governance structures affect decision quality and process?
3. What patterns of interaction emerge between AI agents with different reasoning approaches?
4. How resilient is multi-agent governance to various failure modes?
5. Can this approach mitigate some of the risks associated with singleton AI systems?

### Model Selection Strategy

Two approaches to consider for agent differentiation:

**Option 1: Same Base Model with Different Prompting/Fine-tuning**

- Use a single open-source model (e.g., Llama 3) as the foundation for all agents
- Differentiate agents through specialized fine-tuning and system prompts
- Advantages: Easier to implement, controlled experiment with fewer variables
- Disadvantages: May limit the diversity of thinking styles

**Option 2: Different Models for Different Agents**

- Use different open-source models for different roles (e.g., Llama 3, Mixtral, Falcon)
- Advantages: More natural diversity in reasoning approaches
- Disadvantages: Harder to control for quality differences between models

For the initial phases, **Option 1** seems most appropriate to control variables while establishing baseline governance dynamics. Option 2 can be explored in later phases.

### Agent Specialization Frameworks

The experiment will explore two primary frameworks for agent specialization:

**1. Philosophical Frameworks**

- Utilitarian Agent: Focused on maximizing positive outcomes for the greatest number
- Deontological (Kantian) Agent: Focused on duties, rights, and universal principles
- Virtue Ethics Agent: Focused on character and what a virtuous agent would do
- Care Ethics Agent: Focused on relationships and contextual care responsibilities

**2. Subject Matter Expertise**

- For domain-specific scenarios (like hospital resource allocation):
    - Medical Ethics Expert: Trained on medical ethics literature
    - Resource Optimization Expert: Specialized in efficiency and resource management
    - Patient Advocacy Expert: Represents patient interests and quality of life
    - Public Health Expert: Focuses on population-level outcomes

### Governance Mechanisms to Test

The project will implement and compare multiple governance structures:

1. **Consensus-Building**: Agents must reach agreement through deliberation
2. **Voting Systems**: Simple majority, weighted voting, or ranked-choice voting
3. **Adversarial Debate**: Structured opposition with a judge agent making final decisions
4. **Sequential Decision-Making**: Each agent refines the previous agent's decision
5. **No Structure**: Observe emergent governance without imposed rules

### Measurement Framework

The experiment will track these aspects to enable comprehensive analysis:

1. **Decision Quality Metrics**:
    
    - Comprehensiveness: How many relevant factors are considered
    - Consistency: How similar are decisions across similar scenarios
    - Creativity: Novel solutions to difficult problems
2. **Process Metrics**:
    
    - Time to decision
    - Number of deliberation rounds
    - Conciseness vs. verbosity of reasoning
    - Coalitions formed between agents
3. **Failure Mode Analysis**:
    
    - Deadlocks: Inability to reach decisions
    - Capture: One perspective dominating others
    - Oscillation: Flip-flopping between options without progress
    - Conformity: Excessive agreement without critical analysis

### Technical Implementation

1. **Infrastructure**:
    
    - Python environment with Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch
    - Docker containers for each agent (for isolation and scaling)
    - Database for experiment tracking (SQLite for simplicity or PostgreSQL for scale)
2. **Communication Framework**:
    
    - JSON-based messaging protocol between agents
    - Structured format for proposals, critiques, and consensus
    - Logging of all inter-agent communications
3. **Scenario Presentation**:
    
    - Standardized input format for presenting problems to the governance system
    - Consistent output format for decisions and reasoning

### Project Phases

#### Phase 1: Agent Development and Specialization

Create and validate individual specialized agents before combining them.

#### Phase 2: Basic Multi-Agent Framework
