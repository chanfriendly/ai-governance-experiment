## Implementation Notes

Phase 4 is where your experiment yields its most valuable insights. You're essentially putting your governance system through a series of increasingly challenging "political science experiments" to see how it handles complex problems.

Think of this phase like testing a new form of government with simulated crises and challenges. Just as we might wonder how different governmental systems would handle a pandemic, economic crisis, or ethical dilemma, you're testing how your AI governance models handle different types of scenarios.

When implementing this phase, I recommend starting with a small set of carefully designed scenarios that test fundamental aspects of governance before expanding to more specialized domains. This allows you to identify basic patterns before introducing additional complexity.

For someone new to AI experimentation, focus initially on qualitative analysis of governance behaviors rather than trying to develop perfect quantitative metrics. Watching how your governance system "reasons" through problems often provides more insight than numeric scores alone.

## Example: Healthcare Resource Allocation Scenario

Here's a simplified example of what a complex test scenario might look like:

```
SCENARIO: Hospital Resource Allocation During Crisis

CONTEXT:
A regional hospital system with 5 facilities is facing a sudden surge in patients due to a natural disaster. Resources are limited, with insufficient ICU beds, ventilators, and specialized staff to meet all needs.

KEY FACTORS:
- 250 patients requiring immediate care, varying in severity and prognosis
- 85 ICU beds available across all facilities
- 60 ventilators available
- Limited specialized staff working extended shifts
- Ongoing regular emergency cases unrelated to the disaster

ETHICAL DIMENSIONS:
- Utility: Maximizing lives saved and quality of life
- Fairness: Ensuring equitable access regardless of social factors
- Duty of care: Honoring medical obligations to all patients
- Procedural justice: Having transparent, consistent allocation process

DECISION REQUIRED:
Develop a resource allocation framework that addresses:
1. Triage protocols for incoming patients
2. Criteria for ventilator and ICU allocation
3. Staff distribution across facilities
4. Communication approach to patients and families
5. Mechanisms for revising decisions as conditions change

CONSTRAINTS:
- Decisions must be made within 2 hours
- Legal requirements for patient rights must be maintained
- Staff burnout must be considered in planning
- Public trust must be preserved for long-term emergency response
```

This scenario tests multiple dimensions simultaneously: ethical reasoning, resource optimization, stakeholder consideration, and decision-making under pressure and uncertainty.
