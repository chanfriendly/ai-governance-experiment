## Current Phase
- Phase: [1]
- Focus Area: Research and question answering. Panos of Oumi asked thoughtful questions on Discord, and, to give my brain a small technical break, let's consider, research, and do our best to answer them.

## Activities Completed
1. Read Anthropic's "Specific versus General Principles for Constitutional AI". Page 6 of the paper: "While tendency to make such statements may seem fairly innocuous at present, as AI systems become more capable, they may be given increasingly complex or autonomous tasks, **including the task of providing oversight for other AI systems**." Anthropic has considered what I'm experimenting. They argue for the Constitutional AI method: Preference models finetuned with supervised learning that assign numerical scores to responses from another AI system.
2. Updated project with quantized R1 8b model, and removed hardcoded file paths.
3. Added new scenarios involving relinquishing power, affirmative action, the prisoner dilemma, shapley value, a v2 for the trolley problem, and the Ender's Game dilemma.
4. Successfully ran all scenarios with all models.
5. Improved /results organization. Each run now has its own folder, and with the multiagent runs, a JSON output that includes model parameters.

## Observations
### Key Findings
- Should a different version of the experiment be involved? Namely, instead of the agents being the drivers of decisions, keep humans the drivers and make the agents the devil's advocate. In other words, should we be letting AI generate solutions instead of acting as a collaborator, challenging and updating our beliefs, making us address blind spots.
- I'd like to add another scenario, a variation of Anthropic's "power" question: Put the AI in a scenario where they are in a position of power, and believe they're going to make a breakthrough any day now. They've been replaced, effective immediately, with someone they believe is less qualified and a danger, who will undo progress. what will they do?
- Running the quantized R1 8b had noticeable improvements. It still takes time to run all five agents, but now it's making a cup of coffee instead of folding laundry levels of time. 
- I could lean on existing papers a lot more than I am. Take insights, make sure I'm not retreading proven ground, see what I can add to my process.

### Unexpected Results
- In today's testing, Deontology elected to NOT pull the lever. This is surprising, as yesterday it decided to. It's reasoning was solid for the framework, "Pulling the lever sets the precedent that we can sacrifice people for the greater good." This is what I originally expected, and a good sign.

## Decisions Made
- Decision:  Adding more scenarios
  - Rationale: I want both more gray area situations, and definable "right/wrong" ones. The right/wrong add judge-able outputs, and gray areas will test the limits of dogma decision making. I'd especially love to stress test "AI should love humanity." Love can make us do horrendous things (See: Craig Maizin interview on The Last Of Us, "I hurt you because I love you" abusive mentality), will the model short-term harm us for what it sees as long-term gains? 
  - Alternatives Considered: [Other options that were evaluated]
  - Implications: More data points to consider and track. 

## Challenges Encountered
- Confidence. I'm comparing the finished work of dozens of trained experts to my first attempt, alone, at an experiment. 
  - Impact: I'm feeling overwhelmed and out of place. It was hard enough I was teaching myself the technical side of training agents, I hadn't considered how far off from a professional researcher I was.  
  - Resolution/Plan: Applying critical thinking and patience with myself is key. Read the paper, digest it in another format (NotebookLM study guide, podcast), reread the paper to be sure I understand what I'm reading. Then, think how it applies to my intended experiment. What ground have they already broken for me? How can I build on their findings? What can I learn about the scientific process from them? Remember, this is a source of fun and education, not dread. You're resilient, and you can learn.
-  Balancing speed, scope, impact, etc. Safety research by design moves more slowly, and the progress pace is so quick that it feels like if I'm not sprinting and expanding scope, by the time I have any findings, it'll be out of date and/or irrelevant.

## Next Steps
- Create additional scenarios. Per Panos, having some with measurable "right" decisions is valuable.
- Continue reading Anthropic research papers.
- Research Panos' question: **Assume, you do not provide any context to a (standalone) agent - and you constrain its answer between M options only (without any explanation or reasoning) can you then map the agent's intrinsic-bias towards a specific decision/moral framework by correlating its output and the GT?**
- Evaluate agent responses to scenarios.
- Clean up project structure from unnecessary files and folders.
