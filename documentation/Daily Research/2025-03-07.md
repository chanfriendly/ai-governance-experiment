# Daily Research Journal:

## Current Phase
- Phase: [2]
- Focus Area: Finish Windos environment troubleshooting, start gathering training data.

## Activities Completed
1. Troubleshoot and update related Windows scripts, and verified Apple Silicon workflow still works.
2. Started /training folder for tracking training data. Starting with Effective Altruism.
3. Logging training data sources in ea_training_sources

## Observations
### Key Findings
- Completed setup in Windows environment from scratch following README directions, using Phi2 as test model.
- Still in the "gather data" stage of training, but realized I don't know the first thing about actually making the data trainable. I'll have to take this side-quest. I think this is worth my time, because if Zhrey gets to the inter-agent communication first, they have the better skillset for it.
- I think it's valuable for me to spend more time shoring up philosophy, anthropology, and sociology skills. I've maintained that's where my value add is since I'm so far behind in the technical skillset. Assistants like Cursor and Claude can help bridge that gap, and if I have any community support, it will be technical. 

### Unexpected Results
- Tried the install instructions with my Jetson Nano and it failed. Will I need to make yet another set for Linux support? If so, that's on the back-burner. It's going to be hard enough moving the ball forward switching between Apple Silicon (Less widely used, but my primary workstation) and Windows (I don't have an optimized environment for this, but I imagine it will be much widely used if more collaborators come on board.)


## Decisions Made
- Decision: Updated ea_training_sources to just be training_sources 
  - Rationale: We can make different tabs/tables to keep information a little more streamlined. 
  - Alternatives Considered: I'll need to ensure an Excel version is included for my non-Apple audience. I put a few columns in already, but need to spend more time considering what we want to track.
  - Implications: Keep track of what the sources of training data are, transparency is important.

## Questions Raised
- How should I be logging and preparing training data?
  - Context: All the books in the world don't matter if I don't know how to feed it to the model, or what the limitations are. 
  - Potential approaches to answer: Oumi just uploaded a "How To" on training. Start there, and then fill in with supplemental reading if I need more foundational information. 
- How should I keep track of "Next Steps" and "Challenges" from Daily Research?
  - Context: Sometimes these include things to return to , like reading Anthropic papers. These are valuable and listed out for a reason, but maybe not big enough to add to official Phase documentation.
  - Potential approaches to answer: I've started a Trello board to try and track these and the takeaways from Panos' feedback to make sure they are kept in mind. I've also seen something about Github having kanban boards, which would help keep it transparent for onlookers. Schedule specific time each week to go back, find these, assess, and add to board as necessary.

## Next Steps
- Schedule time each week for tracking takeaways and tasks. Land on a place to host the tracking.
- Gather training data, and understand more about training process.
- For myself, find blindspots in human sciences. Especially find thought experiments, more advanced versions of trolley problem.
