## Current Phase
- Phase: [1]
- Focus Area: Initial project setup. 

## Activities Completed
1. Created the project architecture, roadmap, phases, documentation templates.
2. Asked Claude for hardware requirements.

## Observations
### Key Findings
-  We are now set up to make incremental progress when there is bandwidth, and keep everything organized.
- Claud recommends starting with an API approach: rent out an online GPU to test the concepts without constraints. Then, test quantization with >7b parameter models on existing hardware. Finally, consider a hardware upgrade (RTX 4070 and up) or cloud computing solutions.


## Decisions Made
- Decision: Quantization
  - Rationale: I'm going to do this experiment, so I don't feel the need to test the concepts. Let's jump straight to trying to prepare the models, then we'll figure out where and how to run them.
  - Alternatives Considered: If job goes well, get an RTX and build a proper server for home. In a pinch, I could also just build several projects so mimic having separate agents, and then feed their answers to each other.
