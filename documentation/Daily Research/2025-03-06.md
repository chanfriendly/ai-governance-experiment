# Daily Research Journal: 2025-03-06

## Current Phase
- Phase: [1]
- Focus Area: Troubleshoot installation instructions. I hadn't tested them in a fresh environment, and a contributor is not able to create the environment.

## Activities Completed
1. Built Windows versions of files and dependencies. 
2. Updated test_agent and test_multiagent to (hopefully) be compatible with both environments.
3. Verified scenario script runs. 

## Observations
### Key Findings
- Very frustrating day. I wanted to get started gathering training data, and Zhrey (rightfully) pointed out the installation instructions didn't work. It didn't even occur to me to test them on a different OS. The entire day has been troubleshooting. We're most of the way done.
- [Observation 2]
- [...]

### Unexpected Results
- The platforms are not agnostic, and adapting it for Windows required significant changes. 
-  Llama.cpp failed every install, always on wheel. I have no idea why.
- [...]

## Decisions Made
- Decision: Abandoned llama.cpp and used HF transformers instead. 
  - Rationale: I don't think this will be of consequence. Llama.cpp was mainly to use my M1's GPU. As long as results are consistent across platforms, I don't mind this.
  - Implications: We'll have to be mindful to validate that we're getting similar results after changing some of the underlying work. Prompts, scenarios, etc are all the same, so I hope this isn't an issue.

## Challenges Encountered
- What wasn't encountered today?
  - Impact: The entire day was lost to getting back to 0. Technically not even at 0 yet. 
  - Resolution/Plan: Keep on keepin' on tomorrow. Try to end the week with a win, then start next week with pulling training data.

## Questions Raised
- Is it running properly, and is it scalable?
  - Context: I'm using an AMD GPU and a small model for testing (GPT2). It successfully completed the trolley problem, but gave an error about tokens as its answer. Claude was not concerned and said it was expected. I just want to be sure it's set up in a universal way so Zhrey and anyone else who contributes doesn't have issues.
  - Potential approaches to answer: Do the best I can, turn it over for feedback and hope it works.

## Next Steps
- I've reorganized the directory to be cleaner, make sure this didn't break anything.
- Ensure new versions of test_agent scripts work with existing  Macbook environment. 
- GPT2 is currently hard-coded in a simple version of windows_inference. Need to make sure the option to change models is built in, and add features back in. 
- Wipe virtual environment and follow instructions from the beginning to make sure they work before flagging Zhrey.
- Add new files to Github repository. **Make sure new test_agent files work with Macbook before replacing old ones.**
