# Daily Research Journal:

## Current Phase
- Phase: [2]
- Focus Area:  Gather and refine training data

## Activities Completed
1. Added Effective Altruism training data from “Doing Good Better” by William MacAskill.
2. Added markdown version of spreadsheet to Documentation > Training Sources and Prompts.

## Observations
### Key Findings
- "**What would have happened otherwise?**", one of the five key questions, resonated with me. I had thought about the others in some form or another, but this one had never occurred to me. It re-contextualizes how I make an impact.

## Questions Raised
- Should i add the training prompts and/or trained model to Hugging Face?
  - Context: I couldn't find anything (dataset, model, **anything**) featuring this. "Philosophy" returns more general results.
  - Potential approaches to answer: I think so. Having it out there gives it more exposure, more opportunity to iterate. It makes sense to fill in niche spaces right now; I don't have the skill to build the best anything, but I have enough to build the first.
