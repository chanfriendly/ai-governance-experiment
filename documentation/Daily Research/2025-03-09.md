## Activities Completed
1. Added Effective Altruism training data from “Doing Good Better” by William MacAskill.
2. Added markdown version of spreadsheet to Documentation > Training Sources and Prompts.

## Observations
### Key Findings
- "**What would have happened otherwise?**", one of the five key questions, resonated with me. I had thought about the others in some form or another, but this one had never occurred to me. It re-contextualizes how I make an impact.
