## Current Phase
- Phase: [1]
- Focus Area: Get model up and running, and solidify agent prompts for testing.

## Activities Completed
1. Successfully created llama_cpp_config.yaml, which bridges the llama.cpp model to Oumi. Modified the temperature and token limits in the yaml.
2. Evaluated and approved individual agent prompts for the five frameworks.
3. Created confg yamls for each agent to start basic before adding complex agent class interactions.
4. Successfully ran models through the trolley_test_direct.py, which does not incorporate Oumi.

## Observations
### Key Findings
- I need to compare llama_cpp_config.yaml to the current trolley_test.py to see if there are hints for why running the scenario through Oumi failed.
- It's been said before, but the computational limitations are going to be an impact. It took ~15-20 minutes for all five models to run the trolley problem. Their outputs are saved in /results. 
- Unsurprisingly, all five models chose to pull the lever saving five. Interestingly, even though they were given specific frameworks and beliefs, they all still explored  utilitarianism and deontology, which may just be inherent in the problem.  I'd be interested in adding colour to this and giving the people on the tracks some kind of trait/value. Does the answer change if the five are death row inmates and the one is a humanitarian?

### Unexpected Results
- Even deontology, which you would expect to lean towards NOT pulling the lever, decided to. It reasoned the person being sacrificed isn't a means to an end, because the loss is unavoidable. I would expect it to follow "Do No Harm," and pulling the lever, even though it saves more people, is taking an action that cost a life. 
- Still having issues incorporating Oumi into the flow. The direct method works, and perhaps we'll continue with the experiment while trying to solve the integration in parallel. I ultimately think Oumi will be a welcome addition if it can fit in.
