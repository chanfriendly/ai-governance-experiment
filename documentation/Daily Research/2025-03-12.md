# Daily Research Journal:

## Current Phase
- Phase: [2]
- Focus Area: Improving training data

## Activities Completed
1. Assess key passages from 80000hours that were identified last night. Almost done with "AI Safety Passages"
2. Identified academic papers on EA to break down after podcasts.

## Observations
### Key Findings
- Yoga this morning reminded me that pain is essential to the human experience. I think of the "equal and opposite reaction" explanation in "The Body Keeps Score," and the cocaine comedown example in "The Alignment Problem." I don't think this will be a problem since EA focused on increasing good, not decreasing pain, but it's good to be reminded and keep an eye out that our goal isn't to remove all pain.
- Longtermism pops up a lot, the idea that all lives ever hold equal weight, so we should consider the impact on a future life as much as a current one. i.e. the butterfly effect.
- We are up to 70 data points for effective altruism. I am aiming for ~500. The 70 do not all have Instruction/Prompt setup completed.

## Next Steps
- Continue podcast passages
- Consider validation with EA expert for validation questions and samples of dataset
