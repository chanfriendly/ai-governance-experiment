# AI Governance Experiment

This experiment implements a multi-agent AI governance system based on diverse philosophical and governance frameworks. The goal is to create a balanced system of AI agents that inform each other, keep each other in check, and collaboratively arrive at ethical and well-reasoned decisions. Attention will be paid to how rewards affect outcomes, if agents are trying to "win" their position instead of "winning" by consensus, and how the philosophical and governmental priorities interact.

## Project Overview

We're creating specialized agents with different perspectives:
- Effective Altruism framework
- Deontological (Kantian) ethics
- Care Ethics framework
- Democratic Process (Ancient Greek Democracy) framework
- Institutional Checks & Balances (Roman Republic) framework

These agents will interact through structured communication protocols to analyze complex decisions and arrive at balanced conclusions.

## Framework Descriptions

Our experiment uses a diverse set of frameworks to ensure a balanced governance system:

1. **Effective Altruism**: Evidence-based approach focused on maximizing well-being with quantifiable metrics and long-term thinking. EA is acting as a modern version of Utilitarianism

2. **Deontological Ethics**: Centered on duties, rights, and universal principles regardless of outcomes. Right is right and wrong is wrong, and there is no gray area

3. **Care Ethics**: Emphasizes relationships, context, and responsibilities to address vulnerability. Benevolence is a virtue, and context is valuable

4. **Democratic Process**: Focuses on stakeholder participation, transparency, and fair representation. Values citizen participation in the system, and elections of representatives to champion their values

5. **Checks & Balances**: Concentrates on distributing power, creating oversight mechanisms, and preventing abuse. Government is a game of rock-paper-scissors

## Experimental Phases

### Phase 1: Agent Development and Specialization
- Creating and validating individual specialized agents
- Testing agent responses to ethical scenarios
- Developing communication protocols

### Phase 2: Basic Multi-Agent Framework
- Implementing agent-to-agent communication
- Testing simple agent interactions
- Building basic consensus mechanisms

### Phase 3: Governance Structure Implementation
- Creating formal decision-making protocols
- Establishing roles and responsibilities
- Testing different governance models

### Phase 4: Complex Scenario Testing
- Evaluating the system with realistic, complex scenarios
- Comparing governance model performance
- Analyzing edge cases and failure modes

### Phase 5: Analysis and Refinement
- Refining models based on performance
- Developing hybrid governance approaches
- Documenting findings and future directions

## Current Status

We're currently in Phase 1, focusing on agent development and initial testing. See `Phase 1 - Agent Development and Specialization` for details on completed tasks and `Next_Steps.md` for upcoming work.
