# AI Governance Experiment: Next Steps

This document outlines the immediate next steps for our AI governance experiment, picking up from where we left off in setting up the initial agent frameworks.

## Phase 1 Revisit Plan

While we're moving forward to Phase 2, we need to revisit several Phase 1 components to strengthen our foundation:

1. **Evaluate Model Responses**: Analyze how well each agent embodies its philosophical framework
2. **Refine Scenarios**: Adjust scenarios based on agent performance and interaction quality
3. **Validate Analysis Tools**: Ensure our metrics accurately capture the philosophical nuances
4. **Prepare for Fine-tuning**: Gather and format training data for future model fine-tuning

This cyclical approach ensures our foundation remains solid as we build more complex interactions.

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 2 Enhancement)

1. **Improve Agent Interaction (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - Strengthen agent identity in prompts to maintain philosophical consistency
   - Enhance context awareness to make agents respond to each other's arguments
   - Create structured response formats that encourage dialogue
   - Implement dialogue memory for more coherent conversations
   - Develop agent-specific configuration files for each philosophical framework

2. **Implement Enhanced Dialogue System**
   - Update agent prompts with dialogue-specific instructions:
     ```
     You are participating in a philosophical dialogue about an ethical scenario.
     Your role is to represent the {agent_name} perspective.
     When responding to other agents, address their arguments directly, explaining
     where you agree or disagree based on your philosophical principles.
     
     Your response should:
     1. Briefly summarize the other agent's key points
     2. Identify areas of agreement and disagreement
     3. Explain your position using core principles from your philosophical framework
     4. Ask at least one question to advance the dialogue
     ```
   - Add context awareness so agents respond directly to each other's arguments
   - Create a more sophisticated dialogue controller that manages turn-taking
   - Implement dialogue history summarization for longer discussions

3. **Develop Dialogue Analysis Tools**
   - Extend our analysis tools to evaluate dialogue quality
   - Create metrics for measuring response relevance between agents
   - Develop visualization tools for dialogue patterns
   - Implement framework adherence tracking in conversations

4. **Test More Complex Scenarios**
   - Create scenarios that highlight differences between philosophical frameworks
   - Develop multi-stage scenarios that require extended reasoning
   - Design scenarios with ambiguous elements to test agent reasoning
   - Create domain-specific scenarios (healthcare, content moderation, etc.)

5. **Prepare for Governance Structure Testing**
   - Design protocols for consensus-building, voting, and adversarial debate
   - Create evaluation metrics for different governance mechanisms
   - Develop templates for governance structure experiments
   - Test simple governance structures with two agents before scaling


## Implementation Plan

For our next session, we will focus on improving agent interaction by:

1. Updating the dialogue system to strengthen agent identity
2. Implementing context awareness in agent prompts
3. Creating a structured response format for better dialogue
4. Testing the improved system with the trolley problem scenario

We will measure success by analyzing whether:
- Agents maintain their philosophical frameworks throughout the dialogue
- Agents directly respond to each other's arguments
- The conversation shows genuine philosophical debate rather than parallel monologuing
- Each agent contributes unique insights based on their framework

Our goal is to create a genuinely interactive dialogue system that demonstrates how different philosophical frameworks approach the same ethical dilemmas, setting the foundation for more complex governance structures in later phases.



## Research Questions to Investigate

1. How consistently do the agents maintain their assigned frameworks across different scenario types?
2. Which frameworks provide more decisive ethical guidance versus more nuanced/contextual responses?
3. Are there scenarios where certain frameworks consistently fail to provide clear guidance?
4. How do we measure and maximize the "distinctiveness" of each agent's perspective?
5. Can we identify patterns of reasoning that are unique to each framework?
6. How does scenario framing affect agent responses within their frameworks
